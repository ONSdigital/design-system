# Migration Guide from version 70.x.x to 71.0.0

# Introduction

This document outlines the steps needed to migrate to version 71.0.0 of our Design System library from versions 70.x.x. This release includes several breaking-changes that may impact your projects. Please follow the guide to ensure a smooth transition.

## Global changes

This section will list all those changes that will impact more than one component

### **_Standardisation of setting heading level across components_**

-   **Description of change:** `titleTag` which usually expects a string like `h3` is being replace by a `headingLevel` which now expects an integer.
-   **Reason for change:** In this update, we are addressing an inconsistency in the components/patterns within our system. Some components utilise titleTag while others use headingLevel to set the HTML tag for titles/headings. This update aims to standardise the usage by migrating all components using titleTag to using headingLevel.

    It's important to note that while a default value is set for the heading level, this could be a breaking change as it may alter the heading level in existing use cases and that the new `headingLevel param will need an integer from now on and not the whole tag.

-   **Components impacted:**
    -   accordion
    -   details
    -   document-list
    -   panel
    -   share-page
    -   tabs
    -   timeline
-   **Steps:**

    1. Locate all instances of `titleTag` in your codebase.
    2. Replace `titleTag` with `headingLevel` and replace the heading tag you had with the relevant integer like below

    -   **Example:**

    ```njk
    OLD
    {{
        onsTimeline({
            "titleTag": "h3"
            })
        }}

    NEW
    {{
        onsTimeline({
            "headingLevel" : 3
            })
        }}
    ```

## Components

This section will list all the changes that are specific to one component.

### **_onsCallToAction_**

-   **Description of change:** The `onsCallToAction` component has been removed.
-   **Reason for change:** The component was removed as it was only developed for use on the Census website.
-   **Steps:**

    1. Locate all instances of `onsCallToAction` in your codebase.
    2. You could update any instance of `onsCallToAction` with `onsButton`. The `onsButton` component is not a replacement for the `onsCallToAction` component so transition will not be like for like.

    -   **Example:**

        ```njk
        OLD
        {% from "components/call-to-action/_macro.njk" import onsCallToAction %}

            {{-
                onsCallToAction({
                    "headingText": 'Call to action heading.',
                    "paragraphText": 'Descriptive text about call to action',
                    "button": {
                        "text": 'Start',
                        "url": '#0'
                    }
                })
            }}
        NEW
        {% from "components/button/_macro.njk" import onsButton %}

            {{
                onsButton({
                    "text": 'Get started',
                    "url": '#0'
                })
            }}
        ```

### **_Footer_**

-   **Description of change:** The `poweredBy` parameter has been removed in favour of `footerLogo`, the `OGLLink` parameter has been updated to `oglLink`.
-   **Reason for change:** This updates the footer component to support an additional logo, allowing for two logos instead of just one. It introduces link param for each logo and offers an alternative layout option to display the logos on opposite sides of the footer. The default layout positions the logos next to each other. Additionally, the implementation is aligned with the header component's multipleLogo feature to ensure consistency across the application. The focus and hover states are also adjusted to avoid extra underlines and to ensure the highlight color wraps only the SVG. The `OGLLink` has been aligned to the camel case naming standard so it's now `oglLink`.
-   **Steps:**
    1. Locate all instances of `poweredBy` in your codebase.
    2. Replace `poweredBy` with `footerLogo`.
    -   **Example:**
        ```njk
            OLD
            {{
                onsFooter({
                    "poweredBy": "<svg></svg>",
                    "OGLLink": true
                })
            }}
            NEW
            {{
                onsFooter({
                    "footerLogo": {
                        "logos": {
                            "logo1": {
                                "logoImage": '<svg></svg>',
                                "logoUrl": "#0"
                            },
                            "logo2": {
                                "logoImage": '<svg></svg>',
                                "logoUrl": "#0"
                            }
                        }
                    },
                    "oglLink": true
                })
            }}
        ```

### **_Summary_**

-   **Description of change:**
    -   summary.summaryTitle is renamed to summary.title
    -   group.groupTitle is renamed to group.title
    -   row.rowTitle is renamed to row.title
    -   row.rowItems is renamed to row.items
    -   rowItem.rowTitle is renamed to item.title
    -   rowItem.rowTitleAttributes is renamed to item.titleAttributes
-   **Reason for change:** In this update, we are addressing an inconsistency in the naming of parameters within the summary component. This change aims to standardize the parameter names for clarity and consistency.
-   **Steps:**
    1. Locate all instances of `poweredBy` in your codebase.
    2. Replace `poweredBy` with `footerLogo`.
    -   **Example:**
    ```njk
    OLD
    {{
        onsSummary({
            "summaries": [
                {
                    "groups": [
                        {
                            "placeholderText": 'test',
                            "id": "turnover",
                            "groupTitle": "Turnover",

                                {

                                    "rowTitle": "What are the dates of the sales period you are reporting for?",

                                        {

                }
            ]
        })
    }}
    ```

### **_Timeline_**

-   **Description of change:** We have made a breaking change to the timeline macro by renaming the `items` parameter to `timelineItems`.
-   **Reason for change:** The reason the parameter is being renamed is to fix a bug which takes place in Jinja where items is a reserved word.
-   **Steps:**

    1. Locate all instances of `items` in your codebase within the timeline component.
    2. Replace `items` with `timelineItems`.

    -   **Example:**

    ```njk
    OLD
    {{ onsTimeline({
        "items": [. . . ],
        "titleTag": "h3"
        })
        }}

    NEW
    {{
        onsTimeline({
            "timelineItems": [. . . ],
            "headingLevel" : 3
            })
        }}
    ```

## When to use this pattern

This pattern should be used when you need to collect an address from a user using the [address finder component](/components/address-finder) inside a form. 

## How to use this pattern

There are two main ways to use this pattern. Addresses can either be [editable](/components/address-finder#editable-addresses) or [non-editable](/components/address-finder#non-editable-addresses). Look at the nunjucks output in both examples below to see how they are configured using the `onsAddressFinder` macro.

The pattern examples below will use client side validation against a set of [validation rules](/components/address-finder#validation).
### Editable address pattern example
The manual address inputs are wrapped within a [fieldset](/components/fieldset) and legend. If used within an `onsQuestion` macro you can pass `legendIsQuestionTitle: true` along with `dontWrap: true` to the `onsAddressFinder` macro.

### Non-editable address pattern example

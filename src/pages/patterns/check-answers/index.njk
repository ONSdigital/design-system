Allow users to check the information they have previously entered and confirm it's correct before submitting it.

## When to use this pattern
Use this pattern when you need to let users check and confirm the information they have given before they complete, for example, a survey questionnaire.

## How to use this pattern
There are currently 3 methods within an EQ survey for playing back respondent data.

{{
    onsList({
        "element": 'ol',
        "itemsList": [
            {
                "href": '#1-the-playback-of-answers-within-a-summary',
                "text": 'The playback of answers within a summary.'
            },
            {
                "href": '#2-the-playback-of-a-single-answer',
                "text": 'The playback of a singular answer.'
            },
            {
                "href": '#3-the-playback-of-multiple-answers-or-a-list-of-options',
                "text": 'The playback of multiple answers or a list of options.'
            }
        ]
    })
}}

Each method allows the respondent to check what they have have previously entered and confirm that the data is correct.

### 1. The playback of answers within a summary
A [summary](/components/summary) lets the user review the answer(s) they have given to a single question or multiple questions, allowing them to edit their answers before completing the survey.

When exporting SVG images for the web you should ensure that styles are exported as *inline* rather than as CSS. This is to ensure that styles are not accidentally overridden as the generated class names are not unique, and allows {{
    onsExternalLink({
        "url": "https://github.com/svg/svgo",
        "linkText": "SVGO"
    })
}} to optimise the file without breaking it.

## How to export from Adobe Illustrator

1. File > Export > Export as

<img class="u-mb-m" src="/patternlib-img/illustrator-export-1.png" alt="Screenshot of File > Export > Export as" style="max-width: 600px" />

2. Select SVG from the drop-down (you might want to check "Use artboards" depending on your asset) and click "Export"

<img class="u-mb-m" src="/patternlib-img/illustrator-export-2.png" alt="Screenshot of selecting SVG from drop-down" style="max-width: 600px" />

3. Set "Styling" to "Inline Style"

<img class="u-mb-m" src="/patternlib-img/illustrator-export-3.png" alt="Screenshot of selecting inline style" style="max-width: 400px" />

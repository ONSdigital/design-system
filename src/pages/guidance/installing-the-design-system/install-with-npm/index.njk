The ONS Design System is available as an {{
    onsExternalLink({
        "url": "https://www.npmjs.com/package/@ons/design-system",
        "linkText": "npm package"
    })
}}. Every release is published to npm and provides a quick way to install everything you need.
Inside the package are the following:

- **components** – each component contains a macro file that can be used in a Nunjucks-compatible application
- **Sass files** – all Sass rules are available to import, either everything or specific parts like a single component or the Sass that controls layout
- **CSS files** – compiled CSS of all components and layout styles
- **JS files** – bundled JavaScript modules
- **fonts, images, favicons** – static assets used in components and templates
- **[base page template](/foundations/page-template)** – a Nunjucks template that contains the core markup and components needed to create an ONS service

To install the ONS Design System npm package you will need to install {{
    onsExternalLink({
        "url": "https://nodejs.org/en/",
        "linkText": "node.js"
    })
}} and you will need a {{
    onsExternalLink({
        "url": "https://docs.npmjs.com/files/package.json",
        "linkText": "package.json"
    })
}} file in the root of your project.

Then run:

{{ onsCodeHighlight({ "code": 'npm install @ons/design-system' }) }}

This will install the latest version of `@ons/design-system` in your `node_modules` folder.

The next step is to get some [styles, scripts and other assets](/guidance/using-css-js-and-assets) working in your project.

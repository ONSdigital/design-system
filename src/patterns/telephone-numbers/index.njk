## When to use this pattern
Only ask users for a telephone number when there is an essential need for your service to use this information e.g. to provide a reminder service.

## How to use this pattern
You should always explain why you need the user's telephone number, letting them know if you will contact them and when.

Use an [input](/components/input) component and set the input type to `tel` to bring up the correct keypad on touch devices.

### Use the autocomplete attribute
Use the `autocomplete` attribute when you are asking for a telephone number to help the user fill out a form more quickly.

To do this, set the autocomplete attribute on the input field to `tel`. See how to do this in the HTML and Nunjucks code tabs in the example above.

You will need to use the autocomplete attribute to meet AA WCAG 2.1 accessibility requirements.

### Validating telephone numbers
You should validate a telephone number and [let the user know if they have entered it incorrectly](#error-messages).

Use the input's [label](/components/label) or [label description](/components/label/#with-description) to provide hint text if you specifically require a certain type or format of telephone number (e.g. UK, international, or mobile).

Use the [ONS house style for writing telephone numbers](https://style.ons.gov.uk/category/house-style/language-and-spelling/#addresses-and-telephone-numbers) if you need to provide an example.

### Error messages
When validating the user’s telephone number, you should follow the [error pattern guidance](/patterns/error-validation), providing specific error messages for the specific errors found.

#### If nothing is entered and the answer is required
Display: ‘Enter [the required telephone number]’, e.g. ‘Enter your telephone number’.

#### If an invalid telephone number is entered
Display: ‘Enter a valid UK telephone number'.

#### If the telephone number is entered in the wrong format
Display: ‘Enter a valid UK telephone number'.

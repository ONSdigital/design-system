How to ask users for their ethnic group or background.

## When to use this pattern
Use this pattern when you need to ask your users to choose and or describe their ethnic group or background.

## How to use this pattern
There are three parts to asking users for their ethnic group or background. Include the hint text for each radio option. It helps users understand what each ethnic group or background includes.

}}

## How to check ethnic group
To help users select or enter a valid ethnic group, you should:
{{
    onsList({
        "itemsList": [
            {
                "text": 'check they have selected a radio button'
            },
            {
                "text": 'allow them to paste into the field if they select “Other ethnic group”'
            },
            {
                "text": 'check they have entered something in the field if they select “Other ethnic group”'
            },
            {
                "text": 'show an error message if they have not selected a required radio button or entered something in when it is required for “Other ethnic group”'
            }
        ]
    })
}}

### Error messages

Use the [correct errors pattern](/patterns/error-validation) and show the error details above the relevant fields.

Guidance on writing error messages can be found in the [radios component](/components/radios).

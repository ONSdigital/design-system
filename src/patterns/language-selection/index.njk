##Â When to use this pattern

This pattern should be used if your service is available in multiple languages.

## How to use this pattern

Language selection is achieved by rendering a language selector in the header element, and a list of available languages in the footer. The header language selector is for viewports larger than mobile, and the footer language selector is for viewports smaller than tablet.

## Examples

### 3 Available languages
{{
    patternlibExample({ "path": "patterns/language-selection/examples/english-ireland/index.njk" })
}}

### 2 Available languages
{{
    patternlibExample({ "path": "patterns/language-selection/examples/cymraeg/index.njk" })
}}

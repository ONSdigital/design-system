## When to use this pattern
Use this pattern whenever you need to prompt your users to give feedback about a live service.

Conduct user research to find out where your users would most likely want to provide feedback. This is typically at the end of a mandatory questionnaire, after they have submitted their answers.

## When not to use this pattern
Don’t ask users for feedback on every page or in the middle of a transaction or mandatory questionnaire they need to complete. 

User research studies found users prefer to give feedback at the end of a questionnaire, rather than be interrupted during it. They don’t expect a response, so wouldn’t give feedback to report technical issues.

If you need to gather feedback as part of a service's alpha or beta phase, the [phase banner](/components/phase-banner) component should be used.

## How to use this pattern
Place the feedback call to action on a page where you want to ask the user for feedback. The link in this call to action should open another page with your feedback form on it.

When the user has submitted the feedback form, you should display a thank you message at the top of the page they launched the feedback form from, using the [success panel](/components/panel#success).

If you need to show the thank you message on it's own page, you should always provide a link back to the page they launched the feedback form from.

## Feedback call to action
Provides a link to the feedback form under a semantically appropriate heading.
{{
    patternlibExample({"path": "components/feedback/examples/feedback/index.njk"})
}}

## Feedback form
A single-page form asking users to enter their feedback and select a category.
{{
    patternlibExample({ "path": "patterns/ask-users-for/feedback/examples/feedback-form/index.njk" })
}}

## How to check a feedback form
To help users enter valid feedback, you should:
{{
    onsList({
        "itemsList": [
            {
                "text": 'check they have selected a radio button'
            },
            {
                "text": 'allow them to paste into the field'
            },
            {
                "text": 'check they have entered something in the field'
            },
            {
                "text": 'show an error message if they have not entered anything or not selected a required radio button or drop-down option'
            }
        ]
    })
}}

### Error messages

Use the [correct errors pattern](/patterns/correct-errors) and show the error details above the relevant fields.

Guidance on writing error messages can be found in the [radios component](/components/radios) or [textarea component](/components/textarea).

{{
    patternlibExample({ "path": "patterns/ask-users-for/feedback/examples/feedback-form-errors/index.njk" })
}}

## Feedback success
A page with success panel, confirming the feedback has been sent.

    patternlibExample({ "path": "patterns/ask-users-for/feedback/examples/feedback-success/index.njk" })
}}

## Research on this pattern
The feedback pattern was last user tested in September 2020. The following findings were reported:
{{
    onsList({
        "itemsList": [
            {
                "text": 'users prefer to give feedback at the end of a questionnaire or survey, rather than be interrupted during it'
            },
            {
                "text": 'users do not expect to use the feedback form to report technical issues they are having with the service'
            },
            {
                "text": 'if the feedback call to action is placed alongside a call to action for another optional process, such as getting a confirmation email, it should also be displayed at the end of that process'
            },
            {
                "text": 'users do not expect a reply to the feedback they give, but they want to know how it will be used'
            },
            {
                "text": 'the content of the feedback success message must not appear too “automated” as this gives the impression that the user’s feedback will not be looked at'
            }
        ]
    })
}}

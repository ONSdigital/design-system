Help users define relationships between household members.

{{
    patternlibExample({"path": "components/relationships/examples/relationships/index.njk"})
}}

## When to use this pattern
This pattern should be used when you need to collect the relationship between two people.

## How to use this pattern
Call `onsRelationships` within `onsQuestion`, setting `readDescriptionFirst: true` so the description is read before the incomplete sentence in the heading. This helps to add context to the heading for users of screen readers.

The pattern is enhanced with JavaScript to complete the sentence in the heading and the `playback`, when the user selects a radio option.

## Research on this pattern
The relationships pattern was last user tested between April and September 2020 during research for Census 2021. The following findings were reported:
{{
    onsList({
        "itemsList": [
            {
                "text": 'users find the playback of the relationship after the radio options a useful way to check their selection is correct'
            },
            {
                "text": 'people with large families find the pattern repetitive and expect the system to infer relationships based on previous answers, for example, the relationship between siblings after the parents have been defined'
            },
            {
                "text": 'users typically find it harder to answer third-person relationships than questions about their own relationship with someone'
            },
            {
                "text": 'some users expect to manually enter the type of relationship after selecting the “Other relation” option'
            },
            {
                "text": 'when answering for a household that has people with identical names, users expect to be asked for a ”preferred” name, which would help them select the relationships'
            }
        ]
    })
}}

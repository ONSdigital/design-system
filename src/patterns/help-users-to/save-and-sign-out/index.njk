Users can save their progress, sign out and return to the service later. “Save and sign out” will appear in the header or the footer (depending on device width).

{{
    patternlibExample({ "path": "patterns/help-users-to/save-and-sign-out/examples/save-and-sign-out-button/index.njk" })
}}

## When to use this pattern

Use this pattern when a user has started a survey after entering an [access code](/patterns/access-codes).

## How to use this pattern

Use the `signoutButton` object that is configured within the [base page template](/foundations/page-template).  This will ensure the [ghost button](/components/button/#ghost) is placed in the header, or footer when there is not enough space available on a small device.

The following should happen when a user selects the “Save and sign out” button:
{{
    onsList({
        "itemsList": [
            {
                "text": "user exits the service"
            },
            {
                "text": "clear any session data from the browser"
            },
            {
                "text": "save any information the user has submitted"
            },
            {
                "text": "direct user to the signed out page"
            }
        ]
    })
}}

### Signed out page

This page needs to do the following:

{{
    onsList({
        "itemsList": [
            {
                "text": "confirm the user’s progress has been saved"
            },
            {
                "text": "warn them to keep their access code safe"
            },
            {
                "text": "have a call to action to access the service again so the user can continue their journey"
            }
        ]
    })
}}

{{
    patternlibExample({ "path": "patterns/help-users-to/save-and-sign-out/examples/signed-out/index.njk" })
}}

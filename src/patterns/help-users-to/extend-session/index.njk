Users who need more time to complete a task when a session expiry time has been set, can extend the amount of given time before it runs out. If a page is idle, this pattern gives the user a warning showing the time remaining before signing the user out of the service if they choose not to continue.

{{
    onsPanel({
        "id": 'panel',
        "body": 'The following example will show a warning when the page is left idle for 10 seconds'
    })
}}
{{
    patternlibExample({ "path": "patterns/help-users-to/extend-session/examples/timeout/index.njk" })
}}

## When to use this pattern

Use this pattern when a service sets a session expiry time to protect the user’s information.

All users must be given the time they require to complete a task. The length of the session set to protect their data from others may not be long enough for some users. 

In order to be accessible to all users, this pattern extends the time given for the user to complete a task when the user:

- interacts with the page
- focuses the page (if returning from another tab or device wakes)
- closes the timeout warning (by selecting the primary action or by pressing the keyboard’s “Esc” key)

### Interacting with the page

The session expiry time will be reset every time the user interacts with the page by scrolling, moving the cursor, using the keyboard, or by selecting anything on the page.

### Focusing the page
If the user leaves the tab or window, or their device goes to sleep, the page will lose focus. The session expiry time will be reset if the page is put back in focus before the session has expired.

### Closing the timeout warning

If the page has not been interacted with, the timeout warning will be displayed for a set number of seconds before the session expiry time. The user can reset the session time by closing the warning by selecting the primary action (“Continue” button) or by pressing the keyboard’s “Esc” key.

## How to use this pattern

Use the [timeout modal component](/components/timeout-modal) for the warning by importing it into the template you are using for any pages with a session expiry. You should set the modal to display for at least 60 seconds.

You will need to create a [session timed out error page](/patterns/error-status-pages/#session-timed-out-error-when-user-is-not-signed-in) to redirect the user to when the session expires. This page should explain why the user has been timed out and provide a link to a page for the user to re-enter their access code or details to access the service again.

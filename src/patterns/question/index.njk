## Accessibility

The Question should always be a `<h1>`

### When the question should be a fieldset and legend

Under certain cirsumstances, the question should be wrapped with a `<fieldset>` element, and the question and question description (if provided) should be wrapped in a `<legend>`. This is to provide context to screen readers about what is being asked when a user focuses on an input element for an answer.

Questions should be wrapped in a fieldset when:

* The question type is [Mutually Exclusive](/components/mutually-exclusive)
* There are multiple answers **only if** the question type is **not** Date Range
* If any of the answers to the questions are [Checkboxs](/components/checkboxes)
* If any of the answers to the questions are [Radios](/components/radio)
* If one of the answers to the question is a [Date](/components/date)
* If any of the answers to the question are a [Duration](/pattern/durations)

## Examples

### Question as a fieldset

{{ patternlibExample({
    "path": "components/question/examples/question-fieldset/index.njk"
}) }}

### Question without a fieldset

{{ patternlibExample({
    "path": "components/question/examples/question-no-fieldset/index.njk"
}) }}

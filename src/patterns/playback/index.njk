{% from "components/lists/_macro.njk" import onsList %}

Allow users to check the information they have previously entered and confirm that it is correct before submitting it.

## When to use this pattern
Use this pattern when you need to let users check and confirm the information they have given before they complete, for example, a survey questionnaire.

## How to use this pattern
There are currently 3 methods within an EQ survey for playing back respondent data.

{{ 
    onsList({
        "element": 'ol',
        "items": [
            {
                "href": '#1-the-playback-of-answers-within-a-summary',
                "text": 'The playback of answers within a summary.'
            },
            {
                "href": '#2-the-playback-of-a-single-answer',
                "text": 'The playback of a singular answer.'
            },
            {
                "href": '#3-the-playback-of-multiple-answers-or-a-list-of-options',         
                "text": 'The playback of multiple answers or a list of options.'
            }
        ]
    }) 
}}

Each method allows the respondent to check what they have have previously entered and confirm that the data is correct.

### 1. The playback of answers within a summary
A summary lets the user review the answer(s) they have given to a single question or multiple questions, allowing them to edit their answers before completing the survey.

#### Grouped summary
A summary of the answers to multiple questions in a section.

{{
    patternlibExample({ "path": "patterns/playback/examples/summary-grouped/index.njk" })
}}

#### Multiple answers
A summary of multiple answers to a single question.

{{
    patternlibExample({ "path": "patterns/playback/examples/summary-multiple/index.njk" })
}}

A summary page should be displayed at the end of a section or at the end of a whole survey.

{% from "views/partials/example/_macro.njk" import patternlibExample %}

Allow users to check the information they have have previously entered and confirm that it is correct before submitting it.

## When to use this pattern
Use this pattern when you need to let users check and confirm the information they have given before they complete, for example, a survey questionnaire.

## How to use this pattern
There are currently 3 methods within an EQ survey for playing back respondent data.

1. <a href="#1-the-playback-of-answers-within-a-summary">The playback of answers within a summary.</a>
2. <a href="#2-the-playback-of-a-single-answer">The playback of a singular answer.</a>
3. <a href="#3-the-playback-of-multiple-answers-or-a-list-of-options">The playback of multiple answers or a list of options.</a>

Each method allows the respondent to check what they have have previously entered and confirm that the data is correct.

### 1. The playback of answers within a summary
A summary lets the user review the answer(s) they have given to a single question or multiple questions, allowing them to edit their answers before completing the survey.

#### Grouped summary
A summary of the answers to multiple questions in a section.
{{
    patternlibExample("patterns/playback/examples/summary-grouped/index.njk")
}}

#### Multiple answers
A summary of multiple answers to a single question.
{{
    patternlibExample("patterns/playback/examples/summary-multiple/index.njk")
}}

A summary page should be displayed at the end of a section or at the end of a whole survey.

## When to use this pattern
Use this pattern whenever you need to prompt your users to give feedback about a live service.

Conduct user research to find out where your users would most likely want to provide feedback. This is typically at the end of a mandatory questionnaire, after they have submitted their answers.

## When not to use this pattern
Don't ask users for feedback on every page or in the middle of a transaction or mandatory questionnaire they need to complete. 

User research studies found users prefer to give feedback at the end of a questionnaire, rather than be interupted during it. They don't expect a response, so wouldn't give feedback to report technical issues.

If you need to gather feedback as part of a service's alpha or beta phase, the [phase banner](/components/phase-banner) component should be used.

## How to use this pattern
Place the feedback call to action on a page where you want to ask the user for feedback. The link in this call to action should open another page with your feeback form on it.

When the user has submitted the feedback form, you should display a thank you message at the top of the page they launched the feedback form from, using the [success panel](/components/panel#success).

If you need to show the thank you message on it's own page, you should always provide a link back to the page they launched the feedback form from.

## Feedback call to action
Provides a link to the feedback form under a semantically appropriate heading.
{{
    patternlibExample({"path": "components/feedback/examples/feedback/index.njk"})
}}

## Feedback form
A single-page form asking users to enter their feedback and select a category.
{{
    patternlibExample({ "path": "patterns/feedback/examples/feedback-form/index.njk" })
}}

## Feedback validation
{{
    patternlibExample({ "path": "patterns/feedback/examples/feedback-form-validation/index.njk" })
}}

## Feedback success
A page with success panel, confirming the feedback has been sent.
{{
    patternlibExample({ "path": "patterns/feedback/examples/feedback-success/index.njk" })
}}

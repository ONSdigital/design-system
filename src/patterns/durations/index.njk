## When to use this pattern

This pattern should be used when you need to collect a duration from a user such as asking how long someone has lived at an address.

## How to use this pattern

Duration inputs can be created by using the duration component. For example:

{{
    patternlibExample({"path": "components/duration/examples/duration-address/index.njk"})
}}

## How to check durations

To help users enter a valid duration, you should:
{{
    onsList({
        "itemsList": [
            {
                "text": 'check they have entered something in the duration fields'
            },
            {
                "text": 'check that what they have entered is valid'
            },
            {
                "text": 'show an error message if they have not entered anything in one of the fields or what they have entered is not valid'
            }
        ]
    })
}}

### Error messages

Use the [correct errors pattern](/patterns/error-validation) and show the error details above the duration fields.

{{
    patternlibExample({"path": "components/duration/examples/duration-address-error/index.njk"})
}}

If only one of the duration fields is causing a validation error, you can add error styling to just that single field by setting the additional `error` parameter.

{{
    patternlibExample({"path": "components/duration/examples/duration-error/index.njk"})
}}

#### If all fields are empty
Use “Enter [whatever the duration is]”.
For example, “Enter how long you have lived at this address”.

#### If one of the fields is empty
Use “Enter the number of [whatever the duration is]”.\
For example, “Enter the number of years”.

#### If what is entered in one of the fields is not a number
Use “Enter a number for [invalid field], for example, [appropriate number]”.\
For example, “Enter a number for months, for example, 7”.

#### If what is entered in a field is above the maximum value for that field
Use “Enter a number that is less than [whatever the maximum is for the duration]”.\
For example, “Enter a number that is less than 12” for months.

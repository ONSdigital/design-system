##Â When to use this pattern

This pattern should be used when you need to collect a duration from a user such as asking how long someone has lived at an address.

## How to use this pattern

Duration inputs can be created by wrapping suffixed number inputs in a `<fieldset>` with a supporting `<legend>`. The inputs should be wrapped in a `<div>` with the class `field__group` and then each input should be wrapped in a `<p>` with the class `field__item`. For example:

{{
    patternlibExample({"path": "patterns/durations/examples/duration-address/index.njk"})
}}

{{
    patternlibExample({"path": "patterns/durations/examples/duration-time/index.njk"})
}}

## Research on this pattern
{% from "components/panel/_macro.njk" import onsPanel %}
{% call onsPanel() %}

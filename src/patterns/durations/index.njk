## When to use this pattern

This pattern should be used when you need to collect a duration from a user such as asking how long someone has lived at an address.

## How to use this pattern

Duration inputs can be created by using the duration component. For example:

{{
    patternlibExample({"path": "components/duration/examples/duration-address/index.njk"})
}}

{{
    patternlibExample({"path": "components/duration/examples/duration-time/index.njk"})
}}

###Errors

If only one of the duration fields is causing a validation error, you can add error styling to just that single field by setting the additional `error` parameter.

{{
    patternlibExample({"path": "components/duration/examples/duration-error/index.njk"})
}}

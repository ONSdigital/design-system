Highlights are visual emphasis used to draw information to the attention of the user.

{{
    patternlibExample("patterns/highlight/examples/highlight/index.njk")
}}

## When to use this pattern

Highlight is used in eQ to draw the attention of the user to a particular value or phrase which is central to the understanding of the sentence. It is used to highlight a section of a sentence or phrase which a user may otherwise miss.

Highlight is also used to indicate a calculated or piped value which was entered previously and is being displayed in a new context.

##Â How to use this pattern

It should be noted that highlight should be applied to an `<em>` element. If it is applied to another element which does not carry semantic emphasis (for example `<span>`) it will fail in its intent as it no longer provides emphasis to all users.

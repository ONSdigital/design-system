How to ask a user for an email address.

{{
    patternlibExample({"path": "components/input/examples/email/index.njk"})
}}

## When to use this pattern

Use this pattern when you need to collect an email address from the user.

## How to use this pattern

When using this pattern you should:
{{
    onsList({
        "itemsList": [
            {
                "text": 'tell users why you need an email address and what it will be used for'
            },
            {
                "text": 'make sure the field can accept all email addresses'
            },
            {
                "text": 'help users enter an email address in the correct format'
            }
        ]
    })
}}

### Explain why you need the email address

Use the `label__description` with the [input component](/components/input) to reassure users why you need an email address and what it will be used for.

### Allow all email addresses

The email address field needs to accommodate the maximum number of characters allowed.  An email address can be up to 320 characters long and include a set of special characters as detailed in the{{
    onsExternalLink({
        "url": "https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc3696#section-3",
        "linkText": "RFC 3696 specification from the Internet Engineering Task Force"
    })
}}

### Validate email addresses

To help users enter a valid email address, you should:

{{
    onsList({
        "itemsList": [
            {
                "text": 'check they have entered the email address correctly'
            },
            {
                "text": 'show error validation messages if they have not entered a valid email address'
            },
            {
                "text": 'allow them to paste the email address'
            },
            {
                "text": 'ask them to confirm it is correct using the <a href="/patterns/check-answers/">check answers pattern</a>'
            }
        ]
    })
}}

#### Error messages

Use the [correct errors pattern](/patterns/error-validation) and show the error details above the email address field if it is missing or incorrect.

{{
    patternlibExample({"path": "patterns/email-addresses/examples/email-error/index.njk"})
}}

##### If the email address is missing

Use “Enter an email address” to explain the error to the user.

##### If the email address is incorrect

Use “Enter an email address in a valid format, for example, name@example.com” to explain the error to the user and give them a clear example of a valid email address.

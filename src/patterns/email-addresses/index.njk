{{
    patternlibExample({"path": "components/input/examples/email/index.njk"})
}}

## When to use this pattern

Follow this pattern when you need to collect an email address from the user.

## How to use this pattern

When using this pattern you should:
{{
    onsList({
        "itemsList": [
            {
                "text": 'tell users why you need their email address and what it will be used for'
            },
            {
                "text": 'make sure the field can accept all email addresses'
            },
            {
                "text": 'help users enter an email address in the correct format'
            }
        ]
    })
}}

### Tell users why you need their email address and what it will be used for

Use the input `label__description` to reassure users. Explaining why you need their email address, and what it will be used for.

### Make sure the field can accept all email addresses

The email address field needs to accommodate the maximum number of characters allowed.  An email address can be up to 320 characters long and include a set of special characters as detailed in the{{
    onsExternalLink({
        "url": "https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc3696#section-3",
        "linkText": "RFC 3696 specification from the Internet Engineering Task Force"
    })
}}

### Help users enter an email address in the correct format

To help users enter a valid email address, you should:

{{
    onsList({
        "itemsList": [
            {
                "text": 'check they have entered the email address correctly'
            },
            {
                "text": 'show error validation messages if they have not entered a valid email address'
            },
            {
                "text": 'allow them to paste the email address'
            },
            {
                "text": 'ask them to confirm it is correct using the <a href="/patterns/check-answers/">check answers pattern</a>'
            }
        ]
    })
}}

#### Error messages

Follow the [correct errors pattern](/patterns/error-validation) and show the error details above the email address field if it is missing or incorrect.

{{
    patternlibExample({"path": "patterns/email-addresses/examples/email-error/index.njk"})
}}

##### If the email address is missing

Use “Enter your email address” to explain the error to the user.

##### If the email address is incorrect

Use “Enter an email address in a valid format, for example, name@example.com” to explain the error to the user and give them a clear example of a valid email address.

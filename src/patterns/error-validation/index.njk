##When to use this pattern

Follow this pattern whenever you need to help your users enter valid and required information in a form.

Validation should occur after the user submits the form.

##How to use this pattern

You must tell the user about missing or incorrect information when they submit a form by displaying:

- A summary listing all the errors on the page
- Details highlighting each erroneous field

###Summary of errors

An [error panel](/components/panel#error) must be displayed above the form when the page reloads, so it's the first element to be read.

The error panel's header must display the number of errors on the page.

The error panel's message must list, and provide an anchor link to, each erroneous fieldset (or field) on the page.

{{
    patternlibExample("patterns/error-validation/examples/page-error/index.njk")
}}

###Error details

You must use an [inline error panel](/components/panel#inline-error) to encapsulate each erroneous field or fieldset.

The [inline error panel](/components/panel#inline-error) content must describe the error and direct the user towards a resolution.

{{
    patternlibExample("patterns/error-validation/examples/error-details/index.njk")
}}

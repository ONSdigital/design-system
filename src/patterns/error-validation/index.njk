##When to use this pattern

Follow this pattern whenever you need to help your users enter valid and required information in a form.

Validation should occur after the user submits the form.

##How to use this pattern

You must tell the user about missing or incorrect information when they submit a form by displaying:

- A summary listing all the errors on the page
- Contextual detail and highlight for each erroneous field

###Error summary

An [error panel](/components/panel#error) must be displayed above the form when the page reloads, so it's the first element to be read.

The error panel's header must display the number of errors on the page.

The error panel's body must contain an anchored list to each erroneous field or fieldset on the page.

{{
    patternlibExample("patterns/error-validation/examples/error-summary/index.njk")
}}

###Error details

You must use an [inline error panel](/components/panel#inline-error) to wrap each erroneous field or fieldset.

The inline error panel text string must describe the error and direct the user towards a resolution.

{{
    patternlibExample("patterns/error-validation/examples/error-details/index.njk")
}}

##Example

The prototype provides an example of form validation for missing and invalid inputs.  Attempt to submit the form as it is to see the validation in action.  

<div class="panel panel--info panel--simple u-mb-m">
    <div class="panel__body">
        <strong>Note:</strong> The form in the example prototype will always fail validation.
    </div>
</div>

{% from "components/button/src/_macro.njk" import onsButton %}
{{- 
    onsButton({
        "type": 'button',
        "text": 'Launch prototype',
        "classes": 'u-mb-m',
        "href": '/patterns/error-validation/examples/errors-proto/'
    }) 
-}}

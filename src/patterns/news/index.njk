How to display, tag, categorise and provide a landing page preview for news articles.

{{
    patternlibExample({ "path": "patterns/news/examples/landing/index.njk" })
}}

## When to use this pattern

Use this pattern to publish a news article to a public-facing website.

## How to use this pattern

Use the [articles component](/components/articles) to build consistent articles.

### Landing page

This page sorts the already-published news so that the most recently posted article is at the top of the list.

Each landing page preview needs to have a:

- short, clearly written title that links to the [news article](https://ons-design-system.netlify.app/components/articles)
- short summary, usually taken from the first paragraph of the article, which should be no more than four lines (around 150 characters)
- [date that follows house style](https://style.ons.gov.uk/category/writing-for-the-web/plain-english), for example, 23 September 2020
- category, which links to the page that lists all articles in that category
- thumbnail image

You can add [related content](https://ons-design-system.netlify.app/components/related-content), which appears on the right-hand side of the landing page. Related content could include a list of categories and/or contact details for the media team. Another optional feature is “[Follow us](https://ons-design-system.netlify.app/styles/typography/#list-with-social-icons)” social media links to Instagram, Facebook, Twitter and LinkedIn.

Add an image to your landing page. If you do not include an image, the system will use a placeholder. Placeholders do not look professional or support the written content to tell a story. The [articles component](/components/articles) has advice on image dimensions.

### Categories

Allocate at least one category to each news article: either press release or statement. The categories then appear on the right-hand side of the landing page. A category that has no posts assigned to it will not be visible on the landing page. If a user selects a category, it takes them to a landing page for all the articles in that category.

Only one category will be visible on the landing page preview, even if the article is assigned to more than one.

{{
    patternlibExample({ "path": "patterns/news/examples/category/index.njk" })
}}

### News article

This is a text page that can include images and videos. It needs to have at least one of the categories: statement or press release.

There is no limit on length. If you think an article seems too long, question the user need for such length with the content author.

The title is important. It will stand out on the landing page and it links users to the article. It needs to:

- be in plain English
- use terms and phrases that reflect the language of users
- be as short as possible
- be frontloaded, with the most important information first

Each article needs to have [Previous and Next skip links](/components/pagination#pager) at the end.

You can add “[Share](/components/share-page)” social media links to Facebook, Twitter and LinkedIn.

{{
    patternlibExample({ "path": "patterns/news/examples/article/index.njk" })
}}

### Tags

Tags are not mandatory. Do not use the Tags block if there are no tags. A tag helps to identify an article, for example, “Census 2021”. Good tags help improve search performance. They need to be an important word or phrase that users will recognise. 

You can use more than one tag for each article. Each tag is highlighted in yellow on the landing page summary. An “All posts [tag name]” landing page lists all the news posts that use that tag on the website.

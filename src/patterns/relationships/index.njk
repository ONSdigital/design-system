## When to use this pattern
This pattern should be used when you need to collect the relationship between two people.

## How to use this pattern
Call `onsRelationships` within `onsQuestion`, setting `readDescriptionFirst: true` so the description is read before the incomplete heading sentence by screen readers, to add context.

The pattern is enhanced with javascript, to complete the sentence in the heading and `playback` when the user selects a radio option.

A start page gives users all the information they need before they start responding to a survey.

{{
    patternlibExample({ "path": "patterns/start-page/examples/start-page/index.njk" })
}}

## When to use this pattern
Always place a start page as the first page of any online survey.  Any required sign up pages should be displayed before the start page.

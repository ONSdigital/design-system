The guide is a collection of related pages with features that help the user understand and navigate a topic or subject.

Each of the related pages within a guide contain a [table of contents](/components/table-of-contents) that shows all pages in the guide.

There is an additional navigation component added to a guide. The [pager](/components/pagination#pager) is displayed at the bottom of each page allowing the user to move on to the next (or previous) page.

## When to use this pattern

Use this pattern when you want to present a collection of related pages on a topic.

## How to use this pattern

View the Nunjucks output below which shows the components required to create the guide pattern.

The first page of a guide serves as the "parent" to the other pages. In the table of contents it should be linked as "Overview".
For accessibility the title `h1` should contain an additional visually hidden `span` that provides the additional "Overview" text, for example:

+++
{% from "components/code-highlight/_macro.njk" import onsCodeHighlight %}
{{ onsCodeHighlight({ "code": '<h1 class="ons-u-mb-l">
  <span class="ons-u-fs-xxl ons-u-db">About the census</span>
  <span class="ons-u-vh">: Overview</span>
</h1>'}) }}
+++

{{
    patternlibExample({ "path": "patterns/pages/guide/examples/guide-overview/index.njk"})
}}

Other pages in the guide (below the parent) should include the title of the parent page before the title of the current page, for example:

{{ onsCodeHighlight({ "code": '<h1 class="ons-u-mb-l">
  <span class="ons-u-fs-m ons-u-db ons-u-mb-xs ons-u-lighter">About the census</span>
  <span class="ons-u-vh">:</span>
  <span class="ons-u-fs-xxl ons-u-db">Why you should take part in the census</span>
</h1>'}) }}

{{
    patternlibExample({ "path": "patterns/pages/guide/examples/guide/index.njk"})
}}

### Right-to-left languages

To display a guide page for a right-to-left language (for example, Arabic) you can set `"bodyClasses": 'ons-rtl'` in the [base page template](/foundations/page-template).

{{
    patternlibExample({ "path": "patterns/pages/guide/examples/rtl/index.njk" })
}}

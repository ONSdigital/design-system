How to display, tag and categorise news articles.

## When to use this pattern

Use this pattern to publish a news article to a public-facing website.

## How to use this pattern

### News index

This index sorts the already-published news so that the most recently posted article is at the top of the list.

Use the [articles component](/components/articles) to build consistent summaries of articles.

A list of [categories](/patterns/news/#categories) appears on the news index, and you could also add contact details for the media team. Another optional feature is “[Follow us](/foundations/typography#inline-list-with-icon-prefix)” social media links to Instagram, Facebook, Twitter and LinkedIn.

If you do not include an image with each article, the news index will use a placeholder. Placeholders do not look professional or support the written content to tell a story. The [articles component](/components/articles) has advice on image dimensions.

### News article

This is a text page that can include images and videos. Each news article is reached through a link on the news index. It needs to have at least one of the categories: statement or press release.

There is no limit on length. If you think an article seems too long, question the user need for such length with the content author.

The title is important. It will stand out on the news index and it links users to the article. It needs to:

- be in plain English
- use terms and phrases that reflect the language of users
- be as short as possible
- be front-loaded, with the most important information first

Each article needs to have [Previous and Next pagination links](/components/pagination#pager) at the end.

You can add “[Share](/components/share-page)” social media links to Facebook, Twitter and LinkedIn.

}}

### Categories

Allocate at least one category to each news article: either press release or statement. The categories then appear on the news index. A category that has no posts assigned to it will not be visible on the news index. If a user selects a category, it takes them to a news index for all the articles in that category.

Only one category will be visible on the news index, even if the article is assigned to more than one.

    patternlibExample({ "path": "patterns/pages/news/examples/category/index.njk" })
}}

### Tags

Tags are not mandatory. Do not use the Tags block if there are no tags. A tag helps to identify an article, for example, “Census 2021”. Good tags help improve search performance. They need to be an important word or phrase that users will recognise.

You can use more than one tag for each article. Each tag is highlighted in yellow on the news index. An “All posts [tag name]” news index lists all the news posts that use that tag on the website.

A user may need to contact ONS, for example, to get help with their survey or give feedback. This pattern allows a user to send a message and then the contact centre responds (through a “no reply” email).

{{
    patternlibExample({ "path": "patterns/send-a-web-form/examples/form/index.njk" })
}}

## When to use this pattern

Use this pattern when a user needs to get in touch with us but they do not need an instant response or to talk to someone in the contact centre directly. Use it when we can give a specific response time, such as “We will respond within 48 hours”.

## When not to use this pattern

Do not use this pattern if the user needs to speak to someone at the contact centre, for example, if the details about a business need to change. Do not use this pattern for urgent issues that need a fast response, like problems with the service.

## How to use this pattern

Give users a set of categories to choose from on the web form. These should be based on the most common user needs identified through user research. This helps contact centre staff deal with enquiries.

Only ask the user for the contact details the service needs to handle the request.

The following could be included on a web form:

{{
    onsList({
        "itemsList": [
            {
                "text": 'What do you need help with? (radio selection)'
            },
            {
                "text": 'Please provide more detail (textarea)'
            },
            {
                "text": 'Name (input)'
            },
            {
                "text": 'Email address (input)'
            },
            {
                "text": 'Send message (button)'
            },
            {
                "text": 'Description of what we do with personal data and a link to the privacy statement'
            }
        ]
    })
}}

For “What do you need help with”, the user needs to be offered a selection of radio options, for example:

{{
    onsList({
        "itemsList": [
            {
                "text": 'I need to change my contact details'
            },
            {
                "text": 'I need help with my survey'
            },
            {
                "text": 'I want to make a complaint'
            },
            {
                "text": 'I am having technical difficulties'
            },
            {
                "text": 'I need to change my password'
            },
            {
                "text": 'Something else'
            }
        ]
    })
}}

## Web form errors

{{
    patternlibExample({ "path": "patterns/send-a-web-form/examples/errors/index.njk" })
}}

## Web form success
A page with success panel, confirming the contact form has been sent.

{{
    patternlibExample({ "path": "patterns/send-a-web-form/examples/success/index.njk" })
}}

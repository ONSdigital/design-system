## When to use this pattern

This pattern should be used when you need to collect an address from a user using the [address input component](/components/address-input) inside a form. 

## How to use this pattern to search for addresses

There are three ways to use this pattern. Addresses can either be [editable](/components/address-input#editable-addresses), [non-editable](/components/address-input#non-editable-addresses) or [manual](/components/address-input#how-to-use-this-component-for-manual-address-entry). Look at the nunjucks output in the examples below to see how they are configured using the `onsAddressInput` macro.

### Editable address pattern example
The manual address inputs are wrapped within a [fieldset](/components/fieldset) and legend. If used within an `onsQuestion` macro you can pass `legendIsQuestionTitle: true` along with `dontWrap: true` to the `onsAddressInput` macro. 

The pattern example below will use client side validation against a set of [validation rules](/components/address-input#validation).

{{
    patternlibExample({"path": "patterns/addresses/examples/address-input/index.njk"})
}}

### Non-editable address pattern example

The pattern example below will use client side validation against a set of [validation rules](/components/address-input#validation).

{{
    patternlibExample({"path": "patterns/addresses/examples/address-input-non-editable/index.njk"})
}}

### Manual address pattern example
The manual address inputs are wrapped within a [fieldset](/components/fieldset) and legend. If used within an `onsQuestion` macro you can pass `legendIsQuestionTitle: true` along with `dontWrap: true` to the `onsAddressInput` macro.

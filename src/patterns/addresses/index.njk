##Â When to use this pattern

This pattern should be used when you need to collect an address from a user.

## How to use this pattern

The manual address input should always be wrapped in a fieldset with a legend. This can be achieved by wrapping the address input component in a [question component](/patterns/question) with the `useFieldset` parameter set to true.

{{
    patternlibExample({"path": "components/address/examples/address/index.njk"})
}}

### Asking for an organisation or company's address

An additional field may be configured on the address input if you need to ask for an organisation or company name:

{{
    patternlibExample({"path": "components/address/examples/organisation-address/index.njk"})
}}

##Â When to use this pattern

This pattern should be used when you need to collect an address from a user.

## How to use this pattern

The manual address input wraps itself within a [fieldset](/components/fieldset) and legend.

{{
    patternlibExample({"path": "components/address/examples/address/index.njk"})
}}

### Asking for an organisation or company's address

An additional field may be configured on the address input if you need to ask for an organisation or company name:

{{
    patternlibExample({"path": "components/address/examples/organisation-address/index.njk"})
}}

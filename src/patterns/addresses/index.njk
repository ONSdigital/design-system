## When to use this pattern

This pattern should be used when you need to collect an address from a user.

## How to use this pattern

Ideally, you should use the lookup version of the address input when asking for an address.

### Examples

These examples are powered by an example API running on a small Node App with some dummy data. The [source code](https://github.com/ONSdigital/address-lookup-dummy-service) can be found here and is a good reference for the format in which the address lookup sends and recieves its data.

{{
    patternlibExample({"path": "components/address/examples/address-lookup/index.njk"})
}}

#### Welsh lookup

The address component sends a `lang` parameter in it's query string that matches the `lang` attribtue on the `<html>` element of the page.

{{
    patternlibExample({"path": "components/address/examples/address-lookup-cy/index.njk"})
}}

## Manual only address inputs

The manual address input wraps itself within a [fieldset](/components/fieldset) and legend.

{{
    patternlibExample({"path": "components/address/examples/address/index.njk"})
}}

### Asking for an organisation or company's address

An additional field may be configured on the address input if you need to ask for an organisation or company name:

{{
    patternlibExample({"path": "components/address/examples/organisation-address/index.njk"})
}}

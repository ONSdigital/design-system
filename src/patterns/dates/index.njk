Help users enter a known date.

{{

}}

## When to use this pattern
Use the date pattern when you need to ask users for a date they will already know, or can look up without using a calendar.  For example, their date of birth.

## When not to use this pattern
Don't use the date pattern if you're asking the user about an event they are unlikely to know the exact date of.

## How to use this pattern
The date pattern provides the user with 3 [input](/components/input) fields to enter a day, month, and year.

The 3 input fields are grouped within a [fieldset](/components/fieldset) with a `<legend>` that lets the user know what they need to enter.

A `fieldset__description` is used to provide an example of the required format for the date e.g. 'For example, 31 3 1980'.

{{
    onsPanel({
        "classes": "u-mb-s",
        "body": "<p><strong>Note:</strong> Never automatically tab the user between the fields.  This can be unexpected and confusing, and may hinder normal keyboard control.</p>"
    })
}}
The date fields have a `maxlength` limit set to the maximum number of digits required for day and month (2), and year (4), to prevent users entering too many digits in a single field. This is to help those users who expect auto-tabbing between the fields by preventing them from entering the full date into the first field.

Each field uses the `input--w-<number>` class to set the known number of digits required for each field.

### Using autocomplete when asking for date of birth
Use the `autocomplete` attribute when you are asking for a date of birth to help the user fill out a form more quickly.

To do this, set the `autocomplete` attribute on each of the 3 date input fields to `bday-day`, `bday-month` and `bday-year`.  See how to do this in the HTML and Nunjucks code tabs in the examples above.

You will need to use the autocomplete attribute to meet AA WCAG 2.1 accessibility requirements.


### Error messages
When validating the user's date entry, you should check the entire date, and follow the [error pattern guidance](/patterns/error-validation) when providing specific error messages for the specific errors found.

#### If nothing is entered and the answer is required
Display: 'Enter [the required date]', e.g. 'Enter your date of birth'.

#### If only part of a date is entered
Display: 'Enter a valid date'.

#### If an invalid date is entered
Display: 'Enter a valid date'.

#### If the date entered is not within the required range
Display: 'Enter a 'period to' date later than the 'period from' date.

Help users enter a known date.

## When to use this pattern
Use the date pattern when you need to ask users for a date they will already know, or can look up without using a calendar.  For example, their date of birth.

## When not to use this pattern
Don't use the date pattern if you're asking the user about an event they are unlikely to know the exact date of.

## How to use this pattern
The date pattern provides the user with 3 [input](/components/input) fields to enter a day, month, and year.

The 3 input fields are grouped within a `<fieldset>` with a `<legend>` that lets the user know what they need to do.

{{
    onsPanel({
        "classes": "u-mb-s",
        "body": "<p><strong>Note:</strong> Never automatically tab the user between the fields.  This can be unexpected and confusing, and may hinder normal keyboard control.</p>"
    })
}}

A `<div>` with `field_description` class is used to provide an example of the required format for the date e.g. 'For example, 31 3 1980'.

Each field uses the `input--w-<number>` class to set the known number of digits required for each field.

### Using a date as a question
If the date is the only question you're asking on the page, you can set the date's `<legend>` as the page heading.  This will help the users of screen readers by preventing the duplication of content in the page heading and field legend.

You can do this automatically by setting the date's macro `questionMode` parameter to `true`.

    patternlibExample({"path": "components/date-input/examples/date-input-question/index.njk"})
}}

### Error messages
When validating the user's date entry, you should check the entire date, and follow the [error pattern guidance](/patterns/error-validation) when providing specific error messages for the specific errors found.

#### If nothing is entered and the answer is required
Display: 'Enter [the required date]', e.g. 'Enter your date of birth'.

#### If only part of a date is entered
Display: 'Enter a valid date'.

#### If an invalid date is entered
Display: 'Enter a valid date'.

#### If the date entered is not within the required range
Display: 'Enter a 'period to' date later than the 'period from' date.

## Research on this pattern
{% from "components/panel/_macro.njk" import onsPanel %}
{{ 
    onsPanel({
        "body": "If you have conducted any user research using this pattern, please feed back your findings via the <a href='#design-system-forum'>Design System Forum.</a>"
    }) 
}}

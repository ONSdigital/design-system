Help users enter a known date.

## When to use this pattern
Use the date pattern when you need to ask users for a date they will already know, or can look up without using a calendar.  For example, their date of birth.

## When not to use this pattern
Don't use the date pattern if you're asking the user about an event they are unlikely to know the exact date of.

## How to use this pattern
The date pattern provides the user with 3 [input](/components/input) fields to enter a day, month, and year.

The 3 input fields are grouped within a [fieldset](/components/fieldset) with a `<legend>` that lets the user know what they need to enter.

A `fieldset__description` is used to provide an example of the required format for the date e.g. 'For example, 31 3 1980'.

{{
    onsPanel({
        "classes": "u-mb-s",
        "type": "warn",
        "body": "<p>Never automatically tab the user between the fields. This can be unexpected and confusing, and may hinder normal keyboard control.</p>"
    })
}}
The date fields have a `maxlength` limit set to the maximum number of digits required for day and month (2), and year (4), to prevent users entering too many digits in a single field. This is to help those users who expect auto-tabbing between the fields by preventing them from entering the full date into the first field.

Each field uses the `input--w-<number>` class to set the known number of digits required for each field.

### Using autocomplete when asking for date of birth
Use the `autocomplete` attribute when you are asking for a date of birth to help the user fill out a form more quickly.

To do this, set the `autocomplete` attribute on each of the 3 date input fields to `bday-day`, `bday-month` and `bday-year`.  See how to do this in the HTML and Nunjucks code tabs in the examples above.

You will need to use the autocomplete attribute to meet AA WCAG 2.1 accessibility requirements.

## How to check dates

To help users enter a valid date, you should:
{{
    onsList({
        "itemsList": [
            {
                "text": 'check they have entered something in the date fields'
            },
            {
                "text": 'check that what they have entered is valid'
            },
            {
                "text": 'show an error message if they have not entered anything in one of the fields or what they have entered is not valid'
            }
        ]
    })
}}

### Error messages

Use the [correct errors pattern](/patterns/error-validation) and show the error details above the date fields.

{{
    patternlibExample({"path": "components/date-input/examples/date-input-error/index.njk"})
}}

#### If all fields are empty
Use “Enter [whatever date is being asked for]”.\
For example, “Enter your date of birth”.

#### If one or two of the fields are empty
Use “Enter the [whatever part or parts of the date is missing]”.\
For example, “Enter the year you were born” or “Enter the month and year you were born”.

#### If what is entered in one of the fields is not a number
Use “Enter a number for [invalid field], for example, [appropriate number]”.\
For example, “Enter a number for months, for example, 7”.

#### If what is entered in a field is above the maximum value for that field
Use “Enter a number that is less than [whatever the maximum is for that part of the date]”.\
For example, “Enter a number that is less than 12” for months.

#### If what is entered is not within the required date range
Use “Enter a date that is between [whatever the minimum is] and [whatever the maximum is]”.\
For example, “Enter a date that is between 1 April 2019 and 31 March 2020”.

#### If the date range entered is not valid
Use “Enter a date that is after [whatever the start date is]”.\
For example, “Enter a date that is after 1 January 1999”.

Every page of a website or service needs a page `<title>`. A good page title helps users find what they want and recognise they are in the right place. 

Page titles are the first thing read out by screen readers and the link that shows in search results.

Each page title needs to:
{{
    onsList({
        "itemsList": [
          {
            "text": 'describe what’s on the page'
          },
          {
              "text": 'have the most important words first'
          },
          {
              "text": 'be concise'
          },
          {
              "text": 'use clear, accessible language'
          },
          {
              "text": 'be unique'
          },
          {
              "text": 'avoid internal jargon'
          },
          {
              "text": 'use consistent language, for example, if you use “Start survey” for one page title, it would be inconsistent to use “Submit form” later in the user’s journey'
          }
        ]
    })
}}

Include the site name on the end of each page title so the user is clear about where they are. For example, “Introduction to people who live here – Census 2021” or “Births, deaths and marriages – Office for National Statistics”.

For the [error state](/patterns/correct-errors) version of each page, add “Error: ” at the start of each page title.

The Design System is available as an {{
    onsExternalLink({
        "url": "https://www.npmjs.com/package/@ons/design-system",
        "linkText": "npm package"
    })
}}. Every release is published to npm and provides a quick way to install everything you need. 
Inside the package are the following:

- **components** - Each component contains a macro file that can be used in a nunjucks compatible application
- **sass files** - All sass rules are available to import. You can import everything or specific parts like a single component or the sass that controls layout
- **css files** - Compiled css of all components and layout styles
- **js files** - Bundled javascript modules
- **fonts, images, favicons** - Static assets used in components and templates
- **base page template** - A nunjucks template that contains the core markup and components needed to create an ONS service. Learn more about using the [page template](/styles/page-template)

## Install the Design System npm package

To do this you'll need {{
    onsExternalLink({
        "url": "https://nodejs.org/en/",
        "linkText": "node.js"
    })
}} installed and a {{
    onsExternalLink({
        "url": "https://docs.npmjs.com/files/package.json",
        "linkText": "package.json"
    })
}} file in the root of your project.

Then run:

{{ onsCodeHighlight({ "code": 'npm install @ons/design-system' }) }}
<br>
This will install the latest version of `@ons/design-system` in your `node_modules` folder.

Your next step will probably be to get some [styles, scripts and other assets](/get-started/css-js-assets) working in your project.

An icon can help explain the function of an element, or the direction of a call to action, when it is placed next to the text. For example, a printer icon on a button labelled “Print this page”.

{{
    onsIconSwatch({
        "containerId": 'a-to-z',
        "itemsList": [
            {
                "iconType": 'arrow-next'
            },
            {
                "iconType": 'arrow-previous'
            },
            {
                "iconType": 'check'
            },
            {
                "iconType": 'chevron'
            },
            {
                "iconType": 'download'
            },
            {
                "iconType": 'exit'
            },
            {
                "iconType": 'external-link'
            },
            {
                "iconType": 'lock'
            },
            {
                "iconType": 'person'
            },
            {
                "iconType": 'print'
            },
            {
                "iconType": 'search'
            }
        ]
    })
}}

## When to use icons
Use icons in the same way throughout your product to make it easier to use.

Recognisable icons can make scanning a page quicker, as well as making target areas larger and easier to select. They can also help users who have learning difficulties, such as dyslexia.

You can use an icon with a:
{{
    onsList({
        "itemsList": [
            {
                "text": '<a href="/components/button">button</a>'
            },
            {
                "text": '<a href="/components/panel">panel</a>'
            },
            {
                "text": '<a href="/foundations/typography#lists-with-icons">list</a>'
            },
            {
                "text": '<a href="/components/summary">summary</a>'
            }
        ]
    })
}}

## How to use icons

### Use recognisable icons
Only use icons that are universally understood and have user research evidence to back this up. Recognisable icons help users understand something more quickly. A large familiar icon can be quicker to understand when scanning a page than reading a text label on it’s own.

+++
{% call onsPanel({
        "type": 'warn'
    })
%}
    Always test an icon with users to make sure it means the same to everyone
{% endcall %}
+++

An icon that means different things to different people will make your product harder to use. Always consider if you need to use one at all.

### Use a label
Always use an icon with a text label. Using icons on their own means the user has to think more, especially if the icon is not familiar to them.

There are only a few icons that are universally understood and can be used on their own as an exception – when there is not enough space for a label. For example, a magnifying glass icon on a search field.

### Place icons before text to show function
Place an icon *before* the text to help the user understand the function of the element without having to read the text.

For example, the printer icon comes first on the [print button](#print) so that a user who does not need the text can quickly see that it’s a print button.

{{
    patternlibExample({ "path": "components/button/examples/button-print/index.njk", "componentFolderPath": "components/button" })
}}

### Use navigation icons to show direction
A directional icon should be placed before or after a button label or link to help the user understand the direction they will go if they select it.

Use forward navigation icons after the text and backward navigation icons before the text.

For example, the `arrow-next` icon after the [call to action button](/components/button#call-to-action) shows the button will move the user forward to the next page.

{{
    patternlibExample({ "path": "components/button/examples/button-link/index.njk", "componentFolderPath": "components/button" })
}}

The `chevron` icon before the [back link](/components/back-link) shows the link will move the user back to the previous page.

{{
    patternlibExample({ "path": "components/back-link/examples/back-link/index.njk", "componentFolderPath": "components/breadcrumbs" })
}}

### Icon type
To set the type of icon, use the parameter `iconType` with the [name of the icon](#a-to-z).

### Icon position
You can set an icon’s position to before or after the text on a button or list. Use the parameter `iconPosition` and give it a value of either “before” or ”after”.

### Icon size
You can change the size of an icon on a list or panel – from the default size of regular text – to match the size of the text as detailed in the [typography type scale](/foundations/typography#type-scale).

Use the parameter `iconSize` and give it a value of either: “s”, “m”, “l”, “xl”, “xxl” or “xxxl”.

    patternlibExample({ "path": "foundations/style/icons/examples/icons-size/index.njk", "componentFolderPath": "components/panel" })
}}

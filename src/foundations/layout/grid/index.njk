Use the ONS grid system to lay out the content on your service’s pages.

## Mobile first

We use a responsive, mobile first approach that allows layouts to change to suit the device being used to access the page. The responsive nature of the grid ensures that users have the best available experience regardless of their device or orientation.

## The Grid

We have a flexible grid based on 12 columns, each column has a percentage calculated width. We use a set of device agnostic breakpoints to change the layout when best suited as opposed specific devices. The example below shows the full 12 column grid:

{{
    patternlibExample({"path": "foundations/layout/grid/examples/grid-12/index.njk"})
}}

Use different column widths to make up the 12 available columns:

{{
    patternlibExample({"path": "foundations/layout/grid/examples/grid-combo/index.njk"})
}}

### Spacing

Gutters are fixed for each breakpoint. 24px for screen widths `600px` and greater and 16px for below `600px`. There are options for removing gutters by using modifier classes on the grid which is useful when nesting grids.

The baseline grid is based on multiples of **8px**.

| Viewport | <300px | 301 - 600 | 600 - 1000+ |
|----------|--------|-----------|-------------|
| Gutter   | 16px   | 16px      | 24px        |

#### 600 - 1000+ Grid
Laptop (including tablet in horizontal orientation) and larger resolution devices.

<div class="ons-grid">
    <div class="ons-grid_col ons-col-7@m">
        <img src="/patternlib-img/eq-grid-responsive-large.svg" alt="Grid illustration for larger screen sizes">
    </div>
</div>

#### 301 - 600 and 300 Grid
12 columns with 16px fixed margins for 301-600 and 300px viewports
<div class="ons-grid">
    <div class="ons-grid_col ons-col-7@m">
        <img src="/patternlib-img/eq-grid-responsive-mobile-tablet.svg" alt="Grid illustration for tablet and mobile sizes">
    </div>
</div>

### Breakpoints

There are set breakpoints that can be accessed to adapt the layout for different screen widths.

| Breakpoint | Variable to reference |
|------------|---------------------- |
| 300px      | xxs                   |
| 400px      | xs                    |
| 500px      | s                     |
| 740px      | m                     |
| 980px      | l                     |
| 1300px     | xl                    |
| 1600px     | xxl                   |


## Using the grid system

Grid columns need to be wrapped using the `.ons-grid` class.

Each column within `.ons-grid` requires the class `.ons-grid__col` and another class to specify the number of columns at the required breakpoint, for example `.ons-col-6@m`. This will provide a single column, 6 columns wide at `740px` and greater. If the screen width is below `740px` the column will fill 100% of the content.

A column width can also be set between two breakpoints using the class structure `.ons-col-6@m@xl`. This will provide a 6 column wide column between `740px` and `1300px`. Outside of these widths the column will fill 100% of the content.

**There are additional modifiers that can add further control to the grid:**

### Reversible
`.ons-grid--reverse` - A reversed grid allows you change the source order of the markup and still keep a left-to-right layout.

### Align Mid
`.ons-grid--align-mid` - Uses `vertical-align` to middle align the columns vertically.

### Flexbox
`.ons-grid--flex` `.ons-grid__col--flex` - Provides a more efficient way to lay out, align and distribute space among items in a container. This is beneficial when we need to provide a layout to elements of an unknown/dynamic size. There are more flexbox modifiers which can provide the conditions required at specific breakpoints: `.ons-grid--center`, `.ons-grid--between`, `.ons-grid--vertical-center`, `.ons-u-flex-shrink@m`, `.ons-u-flex-no-shrink@m`, `.ons-u-flex-grow@m`, `.ons-u-flex-no-grow@m`, `.ons-u-flex-no-basis@m`.

### Gutterless
`.ons-grid--gutterless` - Removes all gutters from columns.

### Tight
`.ons-grid--tight` - Uses 1/2 sized gutters.

### Loose
`.ons-grid--loose` - Uses double-sized gutters.

### Spaced
`.ons-grid--spaced` - Adds gutter-sized margins beneath each column. Can be combined with other modifiers that affect margins.

### Pixel Gutters
`.ons-grid--pixelgutter` - Sets the gutters to 1px

### Push &amp; Pull
`.ons-push-1@m` `.ons-pull-1@m` - Moves the `.ons-grid__col` the specified number of columns (at the specified breakpoint/s) either left or right.

## Creating layouts

Layouts can be created by specifying the number of columns required. Grid based layouts should be wrapped with the class `.ons-container`. This will centre the layout and provide a maximum width of `1032px`. There is an additional modifier class `ons-container--wide` which will increase the maximum width to 1280px. If your service requires a full width layout a modifier is available by using `.ons-container--full-width`.

A typical page layout for body content on an ONS service will use 8 columns for the main content at `740px` and greater (`.ons-col-8@m`) as shown below:

{{
    patternlibExample({"path": "foundations/layout/grid/examples/grid-8/index.njk"})
}}


If a sidebar is required, the main content should use 7 columns (`ons-col-7@m`). The sidebar should be 4 columns (`.ons-col-4@m`) and pushed right 1 column (`ons-push-1@m`) to provide a column gap between the main content and the sidebar. The example below shows the layout.

{{
    patternlibExample({"path": "foundations/layout/grid/examples/grid-7-4/index.njk"})
}}

The example below shows the use of flexbox to create the layout for the [phase banner](/components/phase-banner).

{{
    patternlibExample({
        "path": "components/phase-banner/examples/phase-banner-beta/index.njk",
        "openTab": "html"
    })
}}

The community backlog is where we log each proposal for a new feature or a change to an existing feature in the design system.

The Design System Working Group first has to agree to each proposal. They are then put on the backlog in the “to do” column. Anyone in the community can pick up a proposal to develop it.

Items on the {{

        "url": "https://github.com/ONSdigital/design-system/projects/1",

}} are categorised as:

{{

        "itemsList": [
          {
            "text": '<strong>to do</strong> – anything the community has agreed should be in the design system'
          },
          {
              "text": '<strong>in progress</strong> – is being developed'
          },

              "text": '<strong>in review</strong> – needs to be reviewed before publishing'
          },

              "text": '<strong>published</strong> – is live in the design system'
          },
          {
              "text": '<strong>not doing</strong> – any proposal we have decided not to include in the design system'
          }
        ]
    })

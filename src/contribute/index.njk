A community of designers, developers and researchers from across the ONS develop and support the ONS Design System.

You are welcome to make a contribution to the design system. You can [propose a new feature](/contribute/propose-a-new-feature) or [suggest a change to an existing feature](/contribute/propose-a-change) or its documentation.

The community will consider each proposal and decide if your evidence is strong enough for it to go ahead.

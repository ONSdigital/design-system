Adds an image to the page with an optional caption.

## Improved approach for retina screens

Uses two versions of the image, one for standard screens and the other for retina screens.

We specify a folder path for both small and large images which is defined in the macro as `smallSrc` and `largeSrc`. The filename is expected to be the same for both.

{{
    patternlibExample({"path": 'components/images/examples/new/index.njk'})
}}

## Old approach

Specifies a single image that would appear blurry on retina displays.

This continues to use the original macro property `url` for the image path.

{{
    patternlibExample({"path": 'components/images/examples/old/index.njk'})
}}

The back link reuses the same interface and parameters as the [Breadcrumbs](/components/Breadcrumb) component.
Always place back links before a page’s `<main>` content element.  This makes sure the [Skip to content](/components/skip-to-content) link allows the user to skip all navigation, including the back link.
Where possible this should be set in the [page template](/styles/page-template/) in `pageConfig`. This will ensure it will have the correct placing on the page.

## When to use this component
Use the back link to help users go back to the previous page in a linear transaction, or the previous question in a questionnaire.  Use 'previous' as the label in a questionnaire when the previous page is a question.

## When not to use this component
Don’t use the back links component on websites with a flat structure.

If you’re using other navigational elements on the page, such as a sidebar, consider whether your users need the additional support of back links.

A back link is used to help the user go back to the previous page of a transaction or questionnaire.

{{
    patternlibExample({"path": "components/back-link/examples/back-link/index.njk"})
}}

## When to use this component
Always use the back link component on a [question page](/patterns/question/). Use 'previous' as the label in a questionnaire when the previous page is a question.

You should also use a back link on every page of linear transaction, if it makes sense to do so.

Research has shown users don’t often trust the browser back button when navigating back through transactions, especially after submitting form data in financial transactions. Providing a back link helps users feel in control of your service.

## When not to use this component
Don’t use the back link component together with the [breadcrumbs](/components/breadcrumbs) component. Don’t use it on a website content page that is part of a multi-level hierarchy.

## How to use this component
The back link reuses the same interface and parameters as the [breadcrumbs](/components/breadcrumbs) component.

Always place back links before a page’s `<main>` content element.  This makes sure the [Skip to content](/components/skip-to-content) link allows the user to skip all navigation, including the back link.
Where possible this should be set in the [base page template](/foundations/page-template/) in `pageConfig`. This will ensure it will have the correct placing on the page.

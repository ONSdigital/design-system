"title": Date input

The date input component lets users enter a known date using the keyboard.

    patternlibExample("components/date-input/examples/date-input/index.njk")
}}

## When to use this component
Use the date input component when you need to ask users for a date they will already know, or can look up without using a calendar.  For example, their date of birth.

## When not to use this component
Don't use the date input component if you're asking the user about an event they are unlikely to know the exact date of.

## How to use this component
The date input component provides the user with 3 fields to enter a day, month, and year.

The 3 fields are grouped within a `<fieldset>` with a `<legend>` that which lets the user know what they need to do.

A `<div>` with `field_description` class is used to provide an example of the required format for the date e.g. 'For example, 31 3 1980'.

Each field uses the `input--w-<number>` class to set the known number of digits required for each field.

{% from "components/panel/src/_macro.njk" import onsPanel %}
{{
    onsPanel({
        "body": "<strong>Note:</strong> Never automatically tab the user between the fields.  This can be unexpected and confusing, and may hinder normal keyboard control."
    })
}}

### Error messages
When validating the user's entry to the date component, you should check the entire date, and follow the [error pattern guidance](/patterns/error-validation) when providing specific error messages for the specific errors found.

#### If nothing is entered and the answer is required
Display: 'Enter [the required date]', e.g. 'Enter your date of birth'.

#### If only part of a date is entered
Display: 'Enter a valid date'.

#### If an invalid date is entered
Display: 'Enter a valid date'.

#### If the date entered is not within the required range
Display: 'Enter a 'period to' date later than the 'period from' date.

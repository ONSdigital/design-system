"title": Date input

The date input component lets users enter a known date using the keyboard.

{% from "views/partials/example/_macro.njk" import patternlibExample %}

}}

## When to use this component
Use the date input component when you need to ask users for a date they will already know, or can look up without using a calendar.  For example, their date of birth.

## When not to use this component
Don't use the date input component if you're asking the user about an event they are unlikely to know the exact date of.

## How to use this component
The date input component provides the user with 3 fields to enter a day, month, and year.

The 3 fields should be grouped within a `<fieldset>` with a `legend` that describes them.

A `div` with class `field_description` class should be used to provide an example of the required format for the date e.g. 'For example, 31 3 1980'.

Each field should use the `input--w-` utility class to set the known number of digits required for each field.

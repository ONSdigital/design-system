The details component is used to simplify a page by allowing the user to reveal certain content only if they need it.

{{
    patternlibExample({"path": "components/details/examples/details/index.njk"})
}}

## When to use this component
Use the details component to make a page easier to read by condensing information that is only needed by some users.

The details can be used to condense a single block of content into a single selectable heading, allowing the user to reveal it if and when they need it.

Good uses of the details component are:
{{
    onsList({
        "itemsList": [
            {
                "text": 'to reveal additional help at the point where a user may need it, for example, to help answer a question'
            },
            {
                "text": 'to show the definition of a term that may not be well understood'
            }
        ]
    })
}}

## When not to use this component
Don’t use the details component to hide information that the majority of your users will need to progress with their task.

### Alternative components
[Accordions](/components/accordion), [tabs](/components/tabs) and details all hide sections of content which a user can show or hide.

## Variants
Use the details component instead of [tabs](/components/tabs) or [accordions](/components/accordion) if there is only one section of content that needs to be condensed.
### Details with save state enabled
{{
    patternlibExample({"path": "components/details/examples/details-with-saved-state/index.njk"})
}}

### Details with warning panel
{{
    patternlibExample({"path": "components/details/examples/details-with-warning/index.njk"})
}}

## How to use this component
The details component uses JavaScript so when it's turned off, the section of content is expanded and displayed as a standard heading and paragraph.

Use an appropriate heading tag (h2, h3 etc) for the `titleTag` to provide the correct semantic hierarchy to the document with the rest of the page. The default is `H2` if `titleTag` is not provided.

### Use a clear label
The details component hides content so make sure your heading is clear so the user doesn’t need to work hard to understand if they need to click on it.

### Google analytics
Optionally pass event tracking `data` attributes for Google Analytics using `data-ga="click"`, `data-ga-category="definition"`, `data-ga-action="Open/Close panel"`, `data-ga-label="{TITLE}"`

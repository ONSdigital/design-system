Panels are used to draw information to the attention of the user.

## Variants

### Information
{{
    patternlibExample({"path": "components/panel/examples/information/index.njk"})
}}

### Warning
{{
    patternlibExample({"path": "components/panel/examples/warn/index.njk"})
}}

### Warning with session expiry timer
{{
   patternlibExample({"path": "components/timeout-panel/examples/warn/index.njk"})
}}

Use this warning panel variant when a service sets a session expiry time to protect the user’s information.

When the session expiry timer reaches zero, the `countdownExpiredText` message will be displayed and the browser will redirect to the URL set for a [session timed out error page](/patterns/error-status-pages/#session-timed-out-error-when-user-is-not-signed-in). If the current URL is set, the page will reload.

The content of the warning panel is set using the parameters shown in the macro options table in the previous example.

You will also need to set the parameters:

- `sessionExpiresAt` with the current expiry time in ISO format on page load
- `serverSessionExpiryEndpoint` with a relative URL to the server’s API endpoint for the component to send requests to
- `redirectUrl` with a URL to the [session timed out error page](/patterns/error-status-pages/#session-timed-out-error-when-user-is-not-signed-in) the user is directed to when the session has timed out

### Server requirements

The timeout panel requires an API endpoint that handles `GET` request methods and returns a JSON object containing the key `expires_at` with a value for the session expiry time in ISO format.

#### A request for the current expiry time

When a request using a `GET` method is received, the response should contain the current expiry time.

The request is made to check if the same session is being interacted with in another tab.

A request to get the current expiry time will be sent when the following happens:

- at 20-second intervals after the page loads
- before the page starts to redirect

#### Failure responses from the server

If the response status does not have a successful `200` code, the component will handle the response as a session expiry and redirect the user to the URL set in the `redirectUrl` parameter.

### Warning branded
This example is a warning variant designed only for the census respond phase. It is to warn users that they must complete the census by law.
{{
    patternlibExample({"path": "components/panel/examples/warn-branded/index.njk"})
}}

### Announcement
This example is an important announcement.
{{
    patternlibExample({"path": "components/panel/examples/announcement/index.njk"})
}}

### Success
This example uses the `iconType` parameter to show the check icon in the panel. The size of the icon can be set to match the size of the font used in the panel.

There is specific guidance on [how to set the size of an icon](/foundations/icons#icon-size).
{{
    patternlibExample({"path": "components/panel/examples/success/index.njk"})
}}

### Error
There are two types of panel for errors:
- error summary
- error details

There is specific guidance on [how to correct errors](/patterns/correct-errors).

#### Error summary
{{
    patternlibExample({"path": "components/panel/examples/error-header/index.njk"})
}}

#### Error details
{{
    patternlibExample({"path": "components/panel/examples/error/index.njk"})
}}

### Spacious
The spacious variant can be used on all inline variants.
{{
    patternlibExample({"path": "components/panel/examples/information-spacious/index.njk"})
}}

### Branded - census
{{
    patternlibExample({"path": "components/panel/examples/branded/index.njk"})
}}

### Bare
The bare variant is used to show text next to an icon. This is used in the [access codes pattern](/patterns/access-codes).

There is specific guidance on [how to use the available set of icons](/foundations/icons).
{{
    patternlibExample({"path": "components/panel/examples/bare/index.njk"})

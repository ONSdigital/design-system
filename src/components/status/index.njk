## When to use this component
Use status indicators when you need to present a system, page or element status to the user.

## How to use this component
Unless the context of the status indicator makes its use clear and obvious to sighted users, it should be displayed alongside a relevant and consistent label.

For example, a 'Info/neutral' status indicator could be displayed on its own alongside unread messages in a list, to indicate their 'unread' status.

A status type class `status--<type>` sets the color of the status indicator.

## Success
A 'success' status lets the user know when something is either live, complete or successful.
{{
    patternlibExample({"path":"components/status/examples/success/index.njk"})
}}

## Dead
A 'dead' status lets the user know when something is inactive, has not been started or is dead.
{{
    patternlibExample({"path":"components/status/examples/dead/index.njk"})
}}

## Error
An 'error' status lets the user know when something is wrong, refused or has an error.
{{
    patternlibExample({"path":"components/status/examples/error/index.njk"})
}}

## Info/neutral
A 'info/neutral' status lets the user know when something is new, ready or unread.
{{
    patternlibExample({"path":"components/status/examples/info/index.njk"})
}}

## Variants

### Small
Each status 'dot' has a small variant which is applied by adding a `<status type>--small` class to the `<span>`.
{{
    patternlibExample({"path":"components/status/examples/success-small/index.njk"})
}}

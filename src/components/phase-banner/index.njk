title: Phase banner
---
The Phase banner lets users know the service is new and still being worked on, and encourages the user to provide feedback to help improve it.

{% from "views/partials/example/_macro.njk" import patternlibExample %}
{{
    patternlibExample({"path": "components/phase-banner/examples/phase-banner/index.njk"})
}}

## When to use this component
You must use the Phase banner when your service is in the alpha or beta phase and still being developed.

## How to use this component
The Phase banner must be placed directly above the ONS [header](/components/header) at the very top of the page.

### Feedback link
The feedback link should direct users to a form using the [feedback component](/components/feedback) to collect page feedback on the service.
Ensure you always provide the user with a route back to the page they were on when they clicked the link.

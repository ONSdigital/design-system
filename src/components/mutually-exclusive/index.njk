## When to use this component

The mutually exclusive component provides the user with a with a way of selecting multiple items or a single opposing value.

## How to use this component

This component degrades gracefully if JavaScript is not available to the user. If JavaScript is unavailable it is possible for the user to select all options without inverting the selection therefore further, server-side validation should be performed.

Inputs, radios, checkboxes, date inputs, and textareas all call this macro automatically if they have their `mutuallyExclusive` paramater set. This will add the necessary checkbox and aria-live markup, and the classes required by the JavaScript that runs the component. Where you are combining input components such as in the [duration example](#duration) you must call this macro and provide the class `js-exclusive-group-item` to the inputs.

## How to check mutually exclusive answers
To help users select an answer, you should:
{{
    onsList({
        "itemsList": [
            {
                "text": 'check they have selected at least one checkbox'
            },
            {
                "text": 'show an error message if they have not selected any checkbox, including the mutually exclusive checkbox'
            },
            {
                "text": 'show an error message if they have not entered something in any of the fields or selected the mutually exclusive checkbox'
            },
            {
                "text": 'show an error message if what has been entered in an input field is not valid'
            }
        ]
    })
}}

### Error messages

Use the [correct errors pattern](/patterns/error-validation) and show the error details above the fieldset.

{{
    patternlibExample({"path": "components/mutually-exclusive/examples/date-input-error/index.njk"})
}}

Error validation for this component varies according to the mutually exclusive answer type used.

#### If no option is selected for a checkbox-only answer
Use “Select at least one answer”.

#### If all fields are empty and the mutually exclusive checkbox is not selected
Use “Enter [whatever the field requires] or select an answer”.

For example, “Enter your date of birth or select an answer”.

For error validation content guidance for pages with input fields, use one of the following: [dates pattern](/patterns/dates), [textarea component](/components/textarea), [email addresses pattern](/patterns/email-addresses), [numeric values pattern](/patterns/numeric-values), [durations pattern](/patterns/durations).

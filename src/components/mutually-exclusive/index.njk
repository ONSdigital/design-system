## When to use this component

The mutually exclusive component provides the user with a with a way of selecting multiple items or a single opposing value.

## How to use this component

This component degrades gracefully if JavaScript is not available to the user. If JavaScript is unavailable it is possible for the user to select all options without inverting the selection therefore further, server-side validation should be performed.

Inputs, radios, checkboxes, date inputs, and textareas all call this macro automatically if they have their `mutuallyExclusive` paramater set. This will add the necessary checkbox and aria-live markup, and the classes required by the JavaScript that runs the component. Where you are combining input components such as in the [duration example](#duration) you must call this macro and provide the class `js-exclusive-group-item` to the inputs.

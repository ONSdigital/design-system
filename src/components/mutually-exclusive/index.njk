## When to use this component

The mutually exclusive component provides the user with a with a way of selecting multiple items or a single opposing value.

## How to use this component

This component degrades gracefully if JavaScript is not available to the user. If JavaScript is unavailable it is possible for the user to select all options without inverting the selection therefore further, server-side validation should be performed.

Inputs, radios, checkboxes, date inputs, and textareas all call this macro automatically if they have their `mutuallyExclusive` paramater set. This will add the necessary checkbox and aria-live markup, and the classes required by the JavaScript that runs the component. Where you are combining input components such as in the [duration example](#duration) you must call this macro and provide the class `js-exclusive-group-item` to the inputs.

## How to check mutually exclusive answers
To help users select an answer, you should:
{{
    onsList({
        "itemsList": [
            {
                "text": 'check they have selected at least one checkbox'
            },
            {
                "text": 'show an error message if they have not selected any of the checkboxes on a checkbox-only page'
            },
            {
                "text": 'show an error message if they have not selected any of the checkboxes or entered anything in an input field if that is the alternative'
            },
            {
                "text": 'show an error message if what has been entered in an input field is not valid'
            }
        ]
    })
}}

### Error messages

Use the [correct errors pattern](/patterns/error-validation) and show the error details above the fieldset.

{{
    patternlibExample({"path": "components/mutually-exclusive/examples/date-input-error/index.njk"})
}}

Error validation for this component varies according to the mutually exclusive question type used.

#### For mutually exclusive pages that are checkboxes only
If no option has been selected
Use “Select at least one answer”.

#### For mutually exclusive pages where the alternative to a checkbox is for the user to input text
If no checkbox is selected and the input field is empty
Use “Select at least one answer” along with an alternative instruction to enter something into the field.
For example, “Select at least one answer or enter your date of birth”.

For error validation content guidance for pages with input fields, use one of the following: [dates pattern](patterns/dates),  [textarea component](components/textarea), [email addresses pattern](/patterns/email-addresses), [numeric values pattern](/patterns/numeric-values), [durations pattern](/patterns/durations).

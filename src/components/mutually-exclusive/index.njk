## When to use this component

The mutually exclusive component provides the user a way to give an opposing answer to the options provided and say none of the other options apply to them.

## How to use this component

Inputs, radios, checkboxes, date inputs, and textareas all call this macro automatically when the `mutuallyExclusive` parameter is set. This adds the mutually exclusive checkbox, the required aria-live alert markup and the classes required for the JavaScript to run.

## Variants

### Checkboxes

{{
    patternlibExample({"path": "components/mutually-exclusive/examples/checkboxes/index.njk"})
}}

### Date

{{
    patternlibExample({"path": "components/mutually-exclusive/examples/date-input/index.njk"})
}}

### Textarea

{{
    patternlibExample({"path": "components/mutually-exclusive/examples/textarea/index.njk"})
}}

### Email

{{
    patternlibExample({"path": "components/mutually-exclusive/examples/email/index.njk"})
}}

### Number/Currency

{{
    patternlibExample({"path": "components/mutually-exclusive/examples/number/index.njk"})
}}

### Duration

{{
    patternlibExample({"path": "components/mutually-exclusive/examples/duration/index.njk"})
}}

### Multiple mutually exclusive options

When more than one mutually exclusive option is provided the exclusive options become radio buttons.

## How to check mutually exclusive answers
To help users answer a mandatory question using this component, you should:
{{
    onsList({
        "itemsList": [
            {
                "text": 'check they have selected at least one checkbox'
            },
            {
                "text": 'show an error message if they have not selected any checkbox, including the mutually exclusive checkbox'
            },
            {
                "text": 'show an error message if they have not entered something in any of the fields or selected the mutually exclusive checkbox'
            },
            {
                "text": 'show an error message if what has been entered in a field is not valid'
            }
        ]
    })
}}

### Error messages

Use the [correct errors pattern](/patterns/correct-errors) and show the error details above the fieldset.

{{
    patternlibExample({"path": "components/mutually-exclusive/examples/date-input-error/index.njk"})
}}

Error validation for this component varies according to the mutually exclusive answer type used.

#### If no option is selected for a checkbox-only answer
Use “Select [whatever it is]”.\
For example, “Select what type of central heating you have”.

#### If all fields are empty and the mutually exclusive checkbox is not selected
Use “Enter [whatever the field asks for]”.\
For example, “Enter your annual income before tax in 2018/19”.

### If JavaScript is unavailable
If JavaScript is not available it is possible for the user to enter or select both an answer and the mutually exclusive checkbox.

#### If the mutually exclusive checkbox is selected as well as an answer checkbox
Use ‘Select [whatever it is], or select “[the mutually exclusive option]”’.\
For example, ‘Select what type of central heating you have, or select “No central heating”’.

#### If the mutually exclusive checkbox is selected and an answer has been entered into the field
Use ‘Enter [whatever the field asks for], or select “[the mutually exclusive option]”’.\
For example, ‘Enter your annual income before tax in 2018/19, or select “I prefer not to say”’.

Each pattern and component that uses the mutually exclusive component has specific guidance on writing error messages:
{{
    onsList({
        "itemsList": [
            {
                "url": '/patterns/access-codes',
                "text": 'access codes'
            },
            {
                "url": '/patterns/addresses',
                "text": 'addresses'
            },
            {
                "url": '/patterns/dates',
                "text": 'dates'
            },
            {
                "url": '/patterns/durations',
                "text": 'durations'
            },
            {
                "url": '/patterns/email-addresses',
                "text": 'email addresses'
            },
            {
                "url": '/patterns/numeric-values',
                "text": 'numeric values'
            },
            {
                "url": '/patterns/phone-numbers',
                "text": 'phone numbers'
            },
            {
                "url": '/components/textarea',
                "text": 'textarea'
            }
        ]
    })
}}

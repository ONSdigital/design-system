                    <p>Your answers to the census questions will help organisations make decisions on planning and funding public services in your area, including transport, education and healthcare.</p>

                    <p>Over the next year, we work hard to process the answers from all the census questionnaires. This is so that we can publish the initial Census 2021 findings one year after the census and the main releases two years after the census.</p>

                    <p>To make sure the Census 2021 statistics we publish meet the needs of those who use them, we also run an outputs consultation.</p>

                    <p>The last census took place in 2011. Many people and organisations used information from the 2011 Census in a variety of ways.</p>

                    <p>For example, Bristol City Council used it to inform decisions on how to fund local housing improvements. It was also essential for the charity Redbridge Council for Voluntary Services to help people from ethnic minority groups learn more about dementia.</p>

                    <p>The Census Coverage Survey (CCS) was a short, separate survey that we at the Office for National Statistics (ONS) started six to eight weeks after Census Day.</p>

                    <p>The CCS helps make sure everyone is counted and our census results are as accurate as possible. It asked similar questions to the main census, just fewer of them, at addresses in a selection of postcodes across England and Wales.</p>

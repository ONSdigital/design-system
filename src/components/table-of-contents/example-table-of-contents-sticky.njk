                <p>
                    The census is a survey that happens every 10 years and gives us a picture of all the people and households in England
                    and Wales.
                </p>

                <p>
                    Your answers to the census questions will help organisations make decisions on planning and funding public services in
                    your area, including transport, education and healthcare.

                    Two follow-up surveys, the <a href="#0">Census Coverage Survey</a> and the <a href="#0">Census Quality Survey</a>, help
                    to improve the quality and accuracy of the census results.

                <p>
                    Over the next year, we work hard to process the answers from all the census questionnaires. This is so that we can
                    publish the initial Census 2021 findings one year after the census and the main releases two years after the census.
                </p>

                <p>
                    To make sure the Census 2021 statistics we publish meet the needs of those who use them, we also run an outputs
                    consultation.

                <h2>The last census</h2>
                <p>
                    The last census took place in 2011. Many people and organisations used information from the 2011 Census in a variety of
                    ways.
                </p>

                <p>
                    For example, Bristol City Council used it to inform decisions on how to fund local housing improvements. It was also
                    essential for the charity Redbridge Council for Voluntary Services to help people from ethnic minority groups learn more
                    about dementia.

                    To read more about the benefits that information from the 2011 Census helped to create, visit the Office for National
                    Statistics (ONS) website.

                <p>
                    The Census Coverage Survey (CCS) was a short, separate survey that we at the Office for National Statistics (ONS)
                    started six to eight weeks after Census Day.
                </p>

                <p>
                    The CCS helps make sure everyone is counted and our census results are as accurate as possible. It asked similar
                    questions to the main census, just fewer of them, at addresses in a selection of postcodes across England and Wales.
                </p>

                <p>The CCS has now closed.</p>

Buttons help users carry out important actions on a page like starting a survey or saving their answers.
{{
    patternlibExample({"path": "components/button/examples/button/index.njk"})
}}

## When to use this component
Use a button to help direct users to perform a specific action. They should be used to start a process, save users information, and progress through a service.

## How to use this component
Write button text in sentence case, describing the action it performs. The button label should be short, clear and direct. For example ‘Save and continue’ or ‘Sign in’.

Align the primary action button to the left edge of a form.

## Primary (default)
Use a primary button for the main call to action on a page.

Avoid using multiple primary buttons on the same page because it will reduce the impact and make it hard for users to know what to do next.
{{
    patternlibExample({"path": "components/button/examples/button/index.njk"})
}}

## Variants
To use an alternative type of button, set the `variants` parameter to either a single value or an array of multiple values. For example, `"variants": 'small'` or `"variants": ['small', 'secondary']`.

### Small
In certain circumstances there may be the need for multiple primary actions to exist on a page. The small primary button should be used in this scenario only when each action has the same context, for example, a list containing business surveys that a user needs to start.
{{
    patternlibExample({"path": "components/button/examples/button-small/index.njk"})
}}

### Secondary
Use secondary buttons in combination with a primary button for secondary actions on the page. Avoid using too many secondary buttons on the same page as it can make hard for users to know what to do next.
{{
    patternlibExample({"path": "components/button/examples/button-secondary/index.njk"})
}}

### Secondary (small)
A small secondary button should be used within the same context of a primary small button when there is an additional action available along with the primary action.
{{
    patternlibExample({"path": "components/button/examples/button-secondary-small/index.njk"})
}}

### Call to action
The call to action button should be used when a link to a new page is the primary call to action on a page. For example, a “Start survey” button.

Links simply styled as buttons are not accessible to users who navigate a web page with voice commands. Setting the `url` parameter will create a link with `role=button` which will let these users select the button.
{{
    patternlibExample({"path": "components/button/examples/button-link/index.njk"})
}}

#### Call to action opening in a new window
Use this button when a page needs to open in a new window, for example, for a web chat service.

Set the `newWindow` parameter to `true`. This adds a warning for screen reader users so they know a new window will open when they select the button. This helps them understand why the back button in the browser is disabled on the new page.
{{
    patternlibExample({"path": "components/button/examples/button-link-new-window/index.njk"})
}}

### Ghost
The ghosted button style is for use in the [header](/components/header/#external-with-language-and-save-button) or [footer](/components/footer). This can be used to allow a user to exit or [save and sign out](/patterns/help-users-to/save-and-sign-out) of a service.

Setting the `iconType` parameter to `exit` adds an appropriate icon for a 'sign out' or 'exit' button.
{{
    patternlibExample({
        "path": "components/button/examples/button-ghost/index.njk",
        "backgroundColor": "#206095"
    })
}}

### Disabled
Disabled buttons have poor contrast and can confuse some users. Only use disabled buttons if research shows it makes the page easier to understand. For example, the “Send message” button on the [Send and reply to messages
pattern](/patterns/send-and-reply-to-messages/) is disabled until a message is entered into the field.

Use `"variant": 'disabled'` with the `disabled=true` attribute parameter for buttons that have no event/action but need to be displayed.
{{
    patternlibExample({"path": "components/button/examples/button-disabled/index.njk"})
}}

### Loader
The loader button should be used when the button starts a process that can take longer than expected to complete.

Using it will prevent a form being submitted more than once if a user tries to select the button multiple times.

Setting `"submitType": 'loader'` will disable the button when selected and show an animated loading icon.
{{
    patternlibExample({"path": "components/button/examples/button-loader/index.njk"})
}}

### Timer
The timer button can be used to prevent forms being submitted twice when users double-click the submit button. Setting `"submitType": 'loader'` will disable the button for one second after it’s selected.
{{
    patternlibExample({"path": "components/button/examples/button-timer/index.njk"})
}}

### Print
Setting `"buttonStyle": 'print'` will show a button with a print icon and add classes used in the `print-button.js` file.

The button will not show until the JavaScript has run, and will not be shown on a printed page.
{{
    patternlibExample({"path": "components/button/examples/button-print/index.njk"})
}}

### Download
Setting `"buttonStyle": 'download'` will show a button with a download icon and add the `download` attribute to make the browser save the file at the specified `url`.
{{
    patternlibExample({"path": "components/button/examples/button-download/index.njk"})
}}

### Grouping buttons
Placing buttons directly one after the other in your template will display them side by side. This lets you show a positive primary action next to a negative secondary action, for example, “Continue” and “Cancel”.
{{
    patternlibExample({"path": "components/button/examples/button-group/index.njk"})
}}

### Custom icon buttons
You can add an icon to a button using the parameters `iconType` and `iconPosition`.

There is specific guidance on [how to use the available set of icons](/foundations/style/icons).
{{
    patternlibExample({"path": "components/button/examples/button-custom/index.njk"})

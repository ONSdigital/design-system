## How to use this component

Tabs work well when the primary content block is displayed in the first tab. Subsequent tabs can show further detail and/or deeper levels that relate to the primary content (but this isn't a strict rule).

It's important to use tab labels which are succinct, preferably single words to avoid the tab layout breaking. Furthermore, reducing the number of tabs will ensure that the layout doesn't break.

The typical tab display will show on viewports that are equal to or greater than `640px`. 

For viewports `>=640px` the following `aria` attributes will be attached to the `DOM` via javascript on load:

{% md %}
| Element                     	| aria attribute                        	| Description                                                                                                           	|
|-----------------------------	|---------------------------------------	|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------	|
| `ul.tab__list`              	| `role="tablist"`                      	| Convey to screenreaders that the element serves as a container for a set of tabs.                                     	|
| `li.tab__list-item`         	| `role="presentation"`                 	| Convey to screenreaders that this element does not have any functional, interactive, or structural relevance implied. 	|
| `a.tab`                     	| `role="tab"`                          	| Indicates the element serves as a tab control.                                                                        	|
|                             	| `aria-controls="NAME"`                	| Refers to the tab panel element associated with the tab.                                                              	|
|                             	| `aria-selected="true/false"`          	| Indicates if the current tab is selected.                                                                             	|
| `.tab__panel`               	| `aria-labelledby="TITLE_ID"`          	| Indicates the associated tab with the current content.                                                                	|
|                             	| `role="tabpanel"`                     	| Indicates that the element is a content panel with associated tab.                                                    	|
{% endmd %}

For viewport `<640px` tabs are displayed as a list and function as a table of contents (TOC). All panels are displayed in the order they are structured. Clicking a TOC link will jump the user to the associated panel. This is also the solution for non javascript users.

A visually hidden `<h2>` should be added above the tabs list to provide further information and context to screenreader users. This will also be displayed for non javascript users.

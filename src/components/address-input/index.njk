Allows users to find an address using an address finder or enter one manually.

## When to use this component

Use this component to help users either:
- [search for an address](#how-to-use-this-component-with-the-ons-address-index-api) using the ONS Address Index API
- [enter an address manually](#how-to-use-this-component-for-manual-address-entry) using a set of fields

There is specific guidance on [how to ask users for addresses](/patterns/addresses).

## How to use this component with the ONS Address Index API

The address input extends the code base used for the [autosuggest component](/components/autosuggest).

There are two main ways to use this component with the ONS Address Index API. Addresses can be either:
{{
    onsList({
        "itemsList": [
            {
                "text": '<a href="#non-editable-address-finder">non-editable</a>'
            },
            {
                "text": '<a href="#editable-address-finder">editable</a>'
            }
        ]
    })
}}

### Non-editable address finder

Include the parameter `isEditable: false`. You will also need to set other parameters as shown in the Nunjucks options in the example.

When a user selects an address it is displayed in the address finder input.

The UPRN (unique ID) for the selected address is added to a hidden input. This is posted with the rest of the form data when it is submitted.

If there is an issue with the API, the component will disable the address finder and show an error message.

{{ onsPanel({
        "body": '<p>If you cannot use the address finder in the following example you will need to email the Design System working group at <a href="mailto:ONS.Design.System@ons.gov.uk?subject=AIMS API request">ONS.Design.System@ons.gov.uk</a> to ask for access to the API.</p>'
    })
}}

{{
    patternlibExample({"path": "components/address-input/examples/address-input/index.njk"})
}}

### Editable address finder

Include the parameter `isEditable: true`. You will also need to set other parameters as shown in the Nunjucks options in the example.

When a user selects an address, it will be displayed in a set of manual fields. This allows the user to check and edit the address.

If the address is changed, the UPRN (unique ID) is removed and not posted with the rest of the form data.

If there is an issue with the API, the manual fields will be shown instead of the address finder.

{{ onsPanel({
        "body": '<p>If the address finder is not showing in the following example you will need to email the Design System working group at <a href="mailto:ONS.Design.System@ons.gov.uk?subject=AIMS API request">ONS.Design.System@ons.gov.uk</a> to ask for access to the API.</p>'
    })
}}

{{
    patternlibExample({"path": "components/address-input/examples/address-input-editable/index.njk"})
}}

### Using the API

The ONS Address Index API uses a JSON Web Token (JWT) to allow for the transfer of data. Email the Design System working group at <a href="mailto:ONS.Design.System@ons.gov.uk?subject=AIMS API request">ONS.Design.System@ons.gov.uk</a> to let them know your requirements and to set up trusted domains for the API.

Set the values for the parameters `APIDomain` and `APIDomainBearerToken` to allow queries to be passed to the API. Also include the parameter `"externalInitialiser": true` to bypass the default autosuggest methods.

A query is sent to the relevant API endpoint after three characters have been entered into the address finder input. The API will return addresses in groups when the user searches by postcode. If the user searches by another part of the address, the API will return the best matches for that search term.

### Validation

The address autosuggest provides client-side validation when the parameter `mandatory: true` is used. The validation checks if the user has:
{{
    onsList({
        "itemsList": [
            {
                "text": 'entered something in the address finder input'
            },
            {
                "text": 'selected an address from the results'
            },
            {
                "text": 'selected an address from the results and then edited it in the address finder input (non-editable variant only)'
            }
        ]
    })
}}

You will need to include parameters for these error messages:

#### If the address finder input is empty
Use “Enter an address” for the parameter: `errorMessageEnter`

#### If no address is selected from the results
​​Use “Select an address” for the parameter: `errorMessageSelect`

#### If a selected address has been edited in the address finder input
​​Use “Select an address” for the parameter: `errorMessageSelect`

{{
    onsPanel({
        "body": 'If you are using the editable address finder or manual address entry variants, you will need to <a href="patterns/addresses#how-to-check-addresses">check the address</a> using server-side validation.'
    })
}}

### Other API messages
Use the following error messages to improve the address finder results and deal with any loading issues:

#### If no results are found
Use “No results found. Try entering a different part of the address” for the parameter: `noResults`.

#### If the postcode returns too many results
Use “[number of addresses] results found. Enter more of the address to improve results” for the parameter: `tooManyResults`.

#### If more of the address or postcode are needed to get results
Use “Enter more of the address to get results” for the parameter: `typeMore`.

#### If there is an error with the API during use of the editable address finder
Use “Sorry, there is a problem loading addresses. <a href="#0">Enter address manually</a>” for the parameters: `errorMessageAPI` and `errorMessageAPILinkText`.

#### If the API is down before use of the editable address finder
There is a status check when the page loads and initialises the component. If the API is down, a set of fields will allow the user to enter an address manually. This also happens if JavaScript is turned off.

#### If the API is down before or during use of the non-editable address finder
The input will be disabled and an error message shown.

Use “Sorry, there is a problem. We are working to fix it. Please try again later or <a href="#0">contact us for more help</a>.” for the parameters: `errorMessageAPI` and `errorMessageAPILinkText`.

## How to use this component for manual address entry

Include the parameter `manualEntry: true`. You will also need to set other parameters as shown in the Nunjucks options in the following example.

{{
    patternlibExample({"path": "components/address-input/examples/address-input-manual/index.njk"})
}}

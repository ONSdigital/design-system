title: Beta bar
---
The Beta bar lets users know the service is new and still being worked on, and encourages the user to provide feedback to help improve it.

{% from "views/partials/example/_macro.njk" import patternlibExample %}
{{
    patternlibExample({"path": "components/beta-bar/examples/beta-bar/index.njk"})
}}

## When to use this component
You must use the beta bar when your service is in the beta phase and still being developed.

## How to use this component
The beta bar must be placed directly above the ONS [header](/components/header) at the very top of the page.

### Feedback link
The feedback link should direct users to a form using the [feedback component](/components/feedback) to collect page feedback on the service.
Ensure you always provide the user with a route back to the page they were on when they clicked the link.

## Research on this component

    }) 
}}

{% from "views/partials/example/_macro.njk" import patternlibExample %}

The password component lets the user enter a hidden password which they can show if they need to check what they've entered.
{{
    patternlibExample({"path": "components/password/examples/password/index.njk"})
}}

## When to use this component
Use the password component when you need users to create or enter secret information they are likely to want hidden while they enter it.

## How to use this component
The `<input>` and `<label>` is separated by a [checkbox component](/components/checkbox) with classes `js-password-toggle-wrap` and `checkbox--toggle` on the wrapping `<div>` and `js-password-toggle` on the `<input>`.

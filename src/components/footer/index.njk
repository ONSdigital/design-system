### Footer Warning

Use this along with an 'Exit' [ghost button](https://ons-design-system.netlify.app/components/button/#ghost) in the [header](https://ons-design-system.netlify.app/components/header/#external-with-language-and-save-button), if you need to show sensitive information on a post-submission page, such as the user's address or a response ID.

The warning link and header button should clear any `sessionStorage` and should both send the user to a page outside of the transaction.

### Default
{{
    patternlibExample({"path": 'components/footer/examples/footer-no-params/index.njk'})

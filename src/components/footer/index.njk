The footer provides links to supplementary information about your service and the ONS, as well as copyright, licensing and other required legal information.

{{
    patternlibExample({"path": "components/footer/examples/footer/index.njk"})
}}

## When to use this component
You should use the appropriate ONS footer at the bottom of any ONS service.

## Variants

### Transactional
A reduced set of links for use within a transaction funnel, such as a questionnaire.

To prevent the user leaving a transaction, all footer links can be set to open in a new tab. To avoid repeating the new tab icon when setting `“target”: ‘_blank’` for each link, you can set the `newTabWarning` before the links.
{{
    patternlibExample({"path": "components/footer/examples/footer-transactional/index.njk"})
}}

### Welsh
{{
    patternlibExample({"path": "components/footer/examples/footer-cymraeg/index.njk"})
}}

### Alternative organisation
Use the `poweredBy` property to set the `logo` path when a service is being provided by one of our partner organisations.
{{
    patternlibExample({"path": "components/footer/examples/footer-with-alternative-organisation/index.njk"})
}}

### In partnership with ONS
When setting `poweredBy` with the `partnership` parameter, the ONS logo is displayed alongside the partner organisation logo, with a prefix to describe the relationship. For example, “In partnership with”.
{{
    patternlibExample({"path": "components/footer/examples/footer-partnership/index.njk"})
}}

### With the Royal Coat of Arms
Set `“crest”: true` to display the Royal Coat of Arms in the footer.
{{
    patternlibExample({"path": "components/footer/examples/footer-with-coat-of-arms/index.njk"})
}}

### With copyright
Any service using the ONS Address Index API must display Copyright information set by `copyrightDeclaration`.
{{
    patternlibExample({"path": 'components/footer/examples/footer-with-copyright/index.njk'})
}}

### Footer Warning

Use this along with a [ghost button](https://ons-design-system.netlify.app/components/button/#ghost) in the [header](https://ons-design-system.netlify.app/components/header/#external-with-language-and-save-button) to “exit” the session if you need to show sensitive information after the user has completed a transaction, such as the user’s address or a response ID.

The warning link and header button should clear any sensitive data stored in the session and send the user to a page outside the transaction.

{{
    patternlibExample({"path": "components/footer/examples/footer-warning/index.njk"})
}}

### Default
{{
    patternlibExample({"path": 'components/footer/examples/footer-default/index.njk'})
}}

### How to use this component

Cards should be used in the main container of the page and not within side bars, footers etc. The card component needs to be implemented using the `grid` component and the various layout options available to display cards in rows. A row should contain no more than 3 or 4 cards and stack vertically on small viewports.
The `html` tab shows the various classes used to achieve the layout.

### Card set

    patternlibExample({"path": "components/card/examples/card-set/index.njk"})

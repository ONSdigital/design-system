Typeaheads are used to suggest options for answers and typically search code lists such as, Country of Birth, Languages, Nationalities, etc.

{{
    patternlibExample({"path": "components/typeahead/examples/country-of-birth/index.njk"})
}}

## How to use this component

These examples are powered by a JavaScript library called [Fuse.js](https://fusejs.io/). 

### Response object

The typeaheads expect the response from the library to return the results as JSON objects in an array.

### TypeaheadResultItem

The TypeaheadResultItem should consist of at least a key corresponding to the searched language (e.g. `en-gb`) with its corresponding value.

### Example response

```
{
    "results": [
        {
            "en-gb": "United Kingdom",
            "cy": "Deyrnas Unedig"
        }
    ],
    "totalResults": 1
}
```

## Variants

### Country of birth (Cymraeg)

The typeahead component sends a `searchFields` parameter in it's query string that matches the `lang` attribtue on the `<html>` element of the page.

The typeahead component will search the `cy` or the `en-gb` data to find results depending on the `searchFields` parameter.

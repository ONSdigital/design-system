Radios let the user select a single option from a list.

{{
    patternlibExample({"path": "components/radios/examples/radios/index.njk"})
}}

## When to use this component
Use the radio component when you need to help users select a single option from a list.

## When not to use this component
Do not use the radios component if users can choose more than one option from a list. In this case, use the [checkboxes](/components/checkboxes) component.

## How to use this component
Radios are grouped within a [fieldset](/components/fieldset) which starts with a `<legend>` which lets the user know what they need to do.

## Variants

### Descriptions
This variant allows you to add more context to the radios in the list. The description is populated by providing a `description` parameter within the radio’s `label` parameter.

{{
    patternlibExample({"path": "components/radios/examples/radios-descriptions/index.njk"})
}}

### Radio with input
This variant lets the user provide an answer other to the radios in the list, or to provide additional information required to describe their answer.

Use this variation by wrapping the text field in a div with class `ons-radio__other`, added directly after the radio label. CSS hides this field until the radio is `:checked`.

{{
    patternlibExample({"path": "components/radios/examples/radios-other/index.njk"})
}}


### Radio with visible input
This variant of “radio with input” shows the input instead of waiting for the radio to be `:checked`.

{{
    patternlibExample({"path": "components/radios/examples/radios-other-open/index.njk"})
}}

### Radio with drop-down
This variant uses a [select component](/components/select) instead of an input.

{{
    patternlibExample({"path": "components/radios/examples/radios-select/index.njk"})
}}

### Radios with an “or” separator

{{
    patternlibExample({"path": "components/radios/examples/radios-with-or/index.njk"})
}}

### Radios with the option to clear

This variant displays a ”Clear selection” button which allows the user to deselect/clear the fieldset so all radios are not `:checked`. The button is displayed after a radio is selected. The `aria-live` attribute is used for announcing changes in assistive technologies.

If this variant is implemented on a question page that contains a primary submit button, a hidden duplicate submit button should be added to the top of the form to ensure the default enter key behaviour actions this button, and not the clear button.
The submit button should use the `hidden` attribute and also the `u-d-no` utility class to set the button to `display:none`. This hides the button both visually and from screen readers.
{{
    patternlibExample({"path": "components/radios/examples/radios-clear/index.njk"})
}}

## How to check radios
To help users make a selection on the page and provide extra detail if it is required, you should:
{{
    onsList({
        "itemsList": [
            {
                "text": 'check they have selected a radio'
            },
            {
                "text": 'check they have entered something or selected a drop-down option if more detail is required for one of the radios'
            },
            {
                "text": 'show an error message if they have not selected a radio or given any more detail when required'
            }
        ]
    })
}}

### Error messages

Use the [correct errors pattern](/patterns/correct-errors) and show the error details above the radios.

{{
    patternlibExample({"path": "components/radios/examples/radios-error/index.njk"})
}}

#### If a radio has not been selected
Use “Select [whatever it is]”.\
For example, “Select your religion”.

#### If it is a question with yes or no answers and a radio has not been selected
Use “Select an answer”.

#### If “radio with input” is selected but the input field is empty
Use “Enter [whatever it is]”.\
For example, “Enter your gender identity”.

#### If “radio with drop-down” is selected but a drop-down option has not been selected
Use “Select [whatever topic the drop-down is asking for]”.\
For example, “Select your preferred time of day for us to contact you”.

A textarea lets users enter multiple lines of text, such as when answering an open-ended question.

{{
    patternlibExample({"path": "components/textarea/examples/textarea/index.njk"})
}}

## When to use this component
Use the textarea component when you need the user to enter text that's longer than one line, for example, to answer an open-ended question.

A good use of this component is to ask the user for feedback about your service by means of the [phase banner](/components/phase-banner).

## When not to use this component
Open-ended questions can be difficult for users to answer, so consider breaking down the question into simpler questions that can be answered using a single line [input](/components/input) or by selecting an answer using, for example, [radios](/components/radios).

## How to use this component
All textarea components must have a visible [label](/components/label), with or without a description.

Textareas should be appropriately sized to help the user understand what they should enter by making them the right size for the content they are intended for.

### Use appropriately sized textareas
Where possible, you should make the textareas proportional to the amount of text you expect users to enter.

By default, the textarea component will fill the width of its container and has a default height of 8 lines of text.

A [width constraint](/components/input#width-constrained) class can be used to make the width of textarea smaller, or the `rows` parameter can be set to make the height of the textarea larger.

## Variants

### Character limit
The character limit counter is displayed when the `charCheckLimit` object is defined with params `limit`, `charCountSingular`, `charCountPlural` parameters.

{{
    patternlibExample({"path": "components/textarea/examples/textarea-character-limit/index.njk"})
}}

## How to check a textarea
To help users enter something in a required textarea, you should:
{{
    onsList({
        "itemsList": [
            {
                "text": 'check they have entered something in the textarea'
            },
            {
                "text": 'show an error message if they have not entered anything'
            }
        ]
    })
}}

### Error messages
Use the [correct errors pattern](/patterns/correct-errors) and show the error details above the textarea.
{{
    patternlibExample({"path": "components/textarea/examples/textarea-error/index.njk"})
}}

#### If the textarea is empty
Use “Enter [whatever type of text is being asked for]”.\
For example, “Enter your feedback” or “Enter a job title”.

## Research on this component
The textarea component was last user tested between February and September 2020 during research for Census 2021. The following findings were reported:
{{
    onsList({
        "itemsList": [
            {
                "text": 'along with the size of the textarea, the character limit helps users know how long their answer should be'
            },
            {
                "text": 'the character counter is often not noticed until the user starts to enter text'
            },
            {
                "text": 'users that look down at a keyboard while they type may not notice the character counter'
            },
            {
                "text": 'users prefer a limit on characters that can be entered as it prevents them entering far more text than is needed'
            },
            {
                "text": 'the change from black to red text when the character limit is reached helps users notice the counter'
            }
        ]
    })
}}

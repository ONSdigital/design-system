Autosuggest is used to suggest options to users as they enter something into an input field. A user can select one of the suggestions or enter their own answer.

}}

## When to use this component
Use the autosuggest component to help users select from a list of standard responses, for example, countries, languages or nationalities. You could also create your own list for the user to pick from.
## How to use

The list needs to be made available as a JSON file (`.json`). To query the list we use a JavaScript library called {{
        onsExternalLink({
            "url": "https://fusejs.io",
            "linkText": "Fuse.js"
        })
    }}. You will need to provide the URL where the JSON file is stored using the `autosuggestData` parameter.


### List formatting

This code example shows how your JSON should be formatted. The `key` should be the language code that matches the `lang` attribute on the `<html>` element of the page.

{{ onsCodeHighlight({
"code": '[
  {
    "en": "England"
  },
  {
    "en": "Wales"
  },
  {
    "en": "Scotland"
  },
  {
    "en": "Northern Ireland"
  },
]'
}) }}

### Multiple suggestions

You can configure the component to allow multiple suggestions by passing in the parameter `allowMultiple: "true"`.

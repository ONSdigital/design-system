Autosuggests are used to suggest options for answers by searching code lists such as, addresses, countries, languages, nationalities, etc.

## How to use

Autosuggest functionality can be created using the [input](/components/input) component and adding the necessary parameters.

To use this component it is advised that autocomplete is switched off by setting the `autocomplete` parameter to `off`.

### Using a JSON file

{{
    patternlibExample({"path": "components/autosuggest/examples/autosuggest-country/index.njk"})
}}

This example is powered by a JavaScript library called [Fuse.js](https://fusejs.io/).

#### Response object

The autosuggests expect the response from the library to return the results as JSON objects in an array.

#### AutosuggestResultItem

The AutosuggestResultItem should consist of at least a key corresponding to the searched language (e.g. `en-gb`) with its corresponding value.

#### Example response

```
{
    "results": [
        {
            "en-gb": "United Kingdom",
            "cy": "Deyrnas Unedig"
        }
    ],
    "totalResults": 1
}
```

The autosuggest component sends a `searchFields` parameter in it's query string that matches the `lang` attribute on the `<html>` element of the page.

The autosuggest component will search the `cy` or the `en-gb` data to find results depending on the `searchFields` parameter.


### Using the address API
{% from "components/panel/_macro.njk" import onsPanel %}
{{
    onsPanel({
        "body": "This component requires documentation."
    })
}}

{{
    patternlibExample({"path": "components/autosuggest/examples/autosuggest-address/index.njk"})
}}

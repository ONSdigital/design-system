Autosuggests are used to suggest options for answers by searching code lists such as, addresses, countries, languages, nationalities, etc.

## How to use

Autosuggest functionality can be created using the [input](/components/input) component and adding the necessary parameters.

To use this component it is advised that autocomplete is switched off by setting the `autocomplete` parameter to `off`.

### Using a JSON file

{{
    patternlibExample({"path": "components/autosuggest/examples/autosuggest-country/index.njk"})
}}

This example is powered by a JavaScript library called {{
        onsExternalLink({
            "url": "https://fusejs.io",
            "linkText": "Fuse.js"
        })
    }}.


#### Response object

The autosuggests expect the response from the library to return the results as an array.

#### Example response

```
{
    "results": [
        "United Kingdom"
    ],
    "totalResults": 1
}
```

### Using the address API
{{
    onsPanel({
        "body": "This component requires documentation."
    })
}}

{{
    patternlibExample({"path": "components/autosuggest/examples/autosuggest-address/index.njk"})
}}

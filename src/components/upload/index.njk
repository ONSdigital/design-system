A file upload input allows a user to select a file from their computer's file system.
{{
    patternlibExample({"path":"components/upload/examples/upload/index.njk"})
}}

## When to use this component

Use this component when there is a requirement for a user to select and submit a local file as part of their task.

## How to use this component

The `<input>` value is set to `type="file"`. A file upload input also takes the attribute `accepts=` which take a comma separated list of file extensions with the `.` prefix for example: `accept=".xls,.xlsx,.pdf"`.

## How to check uploads
To help users upload a file, you should:
{{
    onsList({
        "itemsList": [
            {
                "text": 'check they have uploaded something'
            },
            {
                "text": 'check that what they have uploaded is a valid file type'
            },
            {
                "text": 'show an error message if they have not uploaded anything or what they have uploaded is not a valid file type'
            }
        ]
    })
}}

### Error messages

Use the [correct errors pattern](/patterns/correct-errors) and show the error details above the checkbox options.

{{
    patternlibExample({"path": "components/upload/examples/upload-error/index.njk"})
}}

#### If no file has been selected
Use “Select a [whatever they need to select]”.\
For example, “Select a report”.

#### If there was a problem and the file was not uploaded
Use “The selected file could not be uploaded. Please try again”.

#### If the file is the wrong file type
Use “Select a file that is [list of file types]”.\
For example, “Select a file that is an XLS, XLSX or PDF”.

#### If the file is too big
Use “Select a file that is smaller than [largest file size]”.\
For example, “Select a file that is smaller than 2MB”.

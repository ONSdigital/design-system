A file upload input allows a user to select a file from their computer's file system.
{{
    patternlibExample({"path":"components/upload/examples/upload/index.njk"})
}}

## When to use this component

Use this component when there is a requirement for a user to select and submit a local file as part of their task.

## How to use this component

The `<input>` value is set to `type="file"`. A file upload input also takes the attribute `accepts=` which take a comma seperated list of file extensions with the `.` prefix for example: `accept=".xls,.xlsx,.pdf"`.

## How to check uploads
To help users upload a file, you should:
{{
    onsList({
        "itemsList": [
            {
                "text": 'check they have uploaded something'
            },
            {
                "text": 'check that what they have uploaded is a valid file type'
            },
            {
                "text": 'show an error message if they have not uploaded anything or what they have uploaded is not a valid file type'
            }
        ]
    })
}}

### Error messages

Use the [correct errors pattern](/patterns/error-validation) and show the error details above the checkbox options.

{{
    patternlibExample({"path": "components/upload/examples/upload-error/index.njk"})
}}

#### If a file has not been selected
Use “Select a file”.

#### If the file is not valid
Use “Select a file that is either a [list valid formats]”.

For example, “Select a file that is either a PDF, XLS or XLSX”.

#### If the file is too big
Use “Select a file that is less than [whatever the maximum is]”.

For example, “Select a file that is less than 10MB”.

#### If there was a problem and the file could not be uploaded
Use “There was a problem uploading the file. Please try again”.

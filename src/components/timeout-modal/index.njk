A timeout warning that lets users extend the amount of time they have to complete a task.

## When to use this component

Use this component when a service sets a session expiry time to protect the user’s information.

There is specific guidance on how to [help users extend a session](/patterns/extend-session/).

## How to use this component

The content of the timeout modal is set using the parameters shown in the macro options table in the previous example.

You will also need to set the parameters:

- `showModalTimeInSeconds` with the number of seconds the modal should show for before the session expiry time (this should be at least 60 seconds)
- `sessionExpiresAt` with the current expiry time in ISO format on page load
- `serverSessionExpiryEndpoint` with a relative url to the server’s API endpoint for the component to send requests to
- `redirectUrl` with a url to the [session timed out error page](/error-status-pages/#session-timed-out-error-when-user-is-not-signed-in) the user is directed to when the session has timed out

### Server requirements

The timeout modal component requires an API endpoint that handles two request methods and returns a JSON object containing the key `expires_at` with a value for the session expiry time in ISO format.

#### 1. A request to reset the expiry time

When a request using a `PATCH` method is received the session expiry time should be reset to the original session length from the current time, and the response should contain the new expiry time.

A request to reset the expiry time will be sent when:

- the page loads and the component initialises
- the modal is closed by the user
- the page receives focus, for example, by returning from another tab or when the device wakes
- the user interacts with the page in any way, for example, by moving the cursor

To efficiently handle the number of requests made when the user interacts with the page, the requests are "throttled" so only one is sent every minute, and others in the queue are cleared.

#### 2. A request for the current expiry time

When a request using a `GET` method is received, the response should contain the current expiry time.

The request is made to check if the same session is being interacted with in another tab. If the expiry time has changed, the timeout will be restarted against the expiry time in the response.

A request to get the current expiry time will be sent when the following happens:

- before the modal opens
- at 20-second intervals while the modal is open
- before the page starts to redirect

#### Failure responses from the server

If the response status does not have a successful `200` code, the component will handle the response as a session expiry and redirect the user to the url set in the `redirectUrl` parameter.

## Accessibility

This component helps services meet WCAG 2.1 success criterion 2.2.1 (Timing Adjustable). This requires services to warn users before a timeout occurs and allow them to extend it.

This component and it's accessibility features are based on the {{

        "url": "https://github.com/alphagov/govuk-design-system-backlog/issues/104",
        "linkText": "GDS timeout modal prototype and research"
    })
}}. We will be carrying out our own accessibility testing to validate it.


### Accessibility requirements

The WCAG  guidelines state:

- there should be no limit to the number of times a user can extend their session
- the timeout modal should announce the remaining time at appropriate intervals to assistive technology
- the underlying page content should be made inert, and the available action on the modal must be put in focus, for example, the “Continue” button
- when the modal is closed the previously focused element on the page must be put back in focus


#### Accessibility attributes on the component’s elements

| Element                | Attribute and value                         | Description                                                                                           |
| ---------------------- | ------------------------------------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `<dialog>`             | `aria-labelledby=”ons-modal-title”`         | To make the contained heading be read out as the title of the modal                                   |
| `<dialog>`             | `role="dialog"`	                           | Makes sure the modal is backwards compatible if the screen reader does not support the html element   |
| `<dialog>`             | `aria-describedby="timeout-time-remaining"` | Reads out the live timer at 15-second intervals                                                       |
| Countdown timer        | `aria-hidden="true"`	                       | Visible countdown timer is hidden from screen readers because it would be too interruptive            |
| Countdown timer        | `aria-relevant=”additions”`	               | A workaround for `aria-hidden` for unsupported JAWS screen reader versions 17 and 18                  |
| Hidden interval timer  | `role="status"`                             | To make sure the hidden interval timer is read out for iOS                                            |
| Hidden interval timer  | `aria-live="polite"`                        | To make sure the hidden interval timer does not interrupt other content being read out                |

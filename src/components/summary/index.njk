A summary presents a clear summarised output of values to the user.
{{
    patternlibExample({"path": "components/summary/examples/summary/index.njk"})
}}

## When to use this component
Display a summary on a page after the user completes a section or full questionnaire, to let them [check and confirm their answers](/patterns/check-answers).

## How to use this component
The summary should provide users with a direct link back to the question(s) they have answered, allowing them to change their answer, then return to the summary to complete or continue their questionnaire.

The summary can contain multiple question and answer types, and will adapt its layout depending on the length of the strings.

The component contains a `summaries` key  which can contain multiple summary `groups`. This allows for multiple summaries to be displayed. Each group in `groups` can have an optional `groupTitle` which provides a heading for the `rows` and renders a `h2`.
This provides flexibility to allow for simple and complex summaries to be created within one instance of the `onsSummary` macro.

## Accessibility
The summary component is made accessible by using the following `aria` attributes which are attached on `domready` via JavaScript:
{{
    onsTable({
        "ths": [
            {
                "value": "Element"
            },
            {
                "value": "ARIA attribute"
            },
            {
                "value": "Description"
            }
        ],
        "trs": [
            {
                "tds": [
                    {
                        "value": "<code>.ons-summary__button</code>"
                    },
                    {
                        "value": '<code>aria-label="{ariaLabel}"</code>'
                    },
                    {
                        "value": "Increases verbosity of the element's label"
                    }
                ]
            }
        ]
    })
}}

### Headers
The parameter `headers` must be provided with an array of values, so screen reader users can understand the purpose of each column in the summary table. For example, for a 2-column summary showing the questions and answers given in a questionnaire should you should set: `"headers": ["Question", "Answer given"]`.

## Variants
### Summary without action
A summary of an answer the user cannot directly change, due to it being automatically calculated.
{{
    patternlibExample({"path": "components/summary/examples/summary-no-action/index.njk"})
}}

### Grouped
A summary of the answers to multiple questions in a section that are grouped.
In this scenario we can create another heading level for `groups` using the `summaryTitle` key which renders a `h2` and renders the `groupTitle` as a `h3`.

{{
    patternlibExample({"path": "components/summary/examples/summary-grouped/index.njk"})
}}

### Multiple
A summary of multiple answers to a single question.

{{
    patternlibExample({"path": "components/summary/examples/summary-multiple/index.njk"})
}}

### Total
{{
    patternlibExample({"path": "components/summary/examples/summary-grouped-total/index.njk"})
}}

### Household
{{
    patternlibExample({"path": "components/summary/examples/summary-household/index.njk"})
}}

### Household no rows

If there are no rows returned the summary will render placeholder text
{{
    patternlibExample({"path": "components/summary/examples/summary-household-no-rows/index.njk"})
}}

### Hub
{{
    patternlibExample({"path": "components/summary/examples/hub/index.njk"})
}}

## How to check a summary of figures
To help users validate a summary of their previous numerical answers, you should:
{{
    onsList({
        "itemsList": [
            {
                "text": 'check that their answers entered on previous pages are accurate'
            },
            {
                "text": 'show an error message if they are not accurate, for example, figures given for percentages do not sum to 100%'
            }
        ]
    })
}}

### Error messages

Use the [correct errors pattern](/patterns/correct-errors) and show the error details above the group of rows in summary.

{{
    patternlibExample({"path": "components/summary/examples/summary-grouped-validation/index.njk"})
}}

#### If there are any errors in the summary
Use “Change one or more of the figures so they sum to [the required amount]”.\
For example, “Change one or more of the figures so they sum to £600”.

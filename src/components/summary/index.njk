{% from "components/table/_macro.njk" import onsTable %}

A summary presents a clear summarised output of values to the user.
{{
    patternlibExample({"path": "components/summary/examples/summary/index.njk"})
}}

## When to use this component
Display a summary on a page after the user completes a section or full questionnaire, to let them [check and confirm their answers](/patterns/playback).

## How to use this component
The summary should provide users with a direct link back to the question(s) they have answered, allowing them to change their answer, then return to the summary to complete or continue their questionnaire.

If the summary is being used at the end of a questionnaire containing multiple sections, the summary `title` should be used as the section heading for each summary block.

The summary can contain multiple question and answer types, and will adapt it's layout depending on the length of the strings.

### Accessibility
The summary component is made accessible by using the following `aria` attributes which are attached on `domready` via JavaScript:
{{
    onsTable({
        "ths": [
            { 
                "value": "Element"
            },
            { 
                "value": "ARIA attribute"
            },
            { 
                "value": "Description"
            } 
        ],
        "trs": [
            {
                "tds": [
                    {
                        "value": "<code>summary__button</code>"
                    },
                    {
                        "value": '<code>aria-label="{ariaLabel}"</code>'
                    },
                    {
                        "value": "Increases verbosity of the element's label"
                    }
                ]
            }
        ]
    })
}}

### Variants
#### Summary without action

    patternlibExample({"path": "components/summary/examples/summary-no-action/index.njk"})
}}

#### Grouped
A summary of the answers to multiple questions in a section.
{{
    patternlibExample({"path": "components/summary/examples/summary-grouped/index.njk"})
}}

#### Multiple
A summary of multiple answers to a single question.

{{
    patternlibExample({"path": "components/summary/examples/summary-multiple/index.njk"})
}}

#### Validation across multiple pages
{{
    patternlibExample({"path": "components/summary/examples/summary-grouped-validation/index.njk"})
}}

#### Total

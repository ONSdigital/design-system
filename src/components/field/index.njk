##Â When to use this component
The field component is used to wrap form input components to provide context (where it renders as a fieldset) and layout.

## How to use this component
Generally speaking you should not need to [call](https://mozilla.github.io/nunjucks/templating.html#call) `onsField` yourself as it is already called from within form input components. However if you need to create a pattern or component that requires a field or `<fieldset>` you can use [nunjucks' call functionality](https://mozilla.github.io/nunjucks/templating.html#call) `onsField`. An example of which can be seen below in the [durations pattern](/patterns/durations):

The field will render as a `<div>` with the class `field` by default, but if there is a `legend` provided in the field [configuration object](#configuration), or `mutuallyExlusive` configuration object provided, it will render as a `<fieldset>` with a coresponding `<legend>`.

{{
    patternlibExample({"path": "patterns/durations/examples/duration-time/index.njk"})
}}

### Configuration
{% md %}
| Name | Type   | Required | Description | 
|------|--------|----------|-------------|
| id   | string | true     | The id of the field or fieldset |
| classes | string | false | Classes to apply to the `<fieldset>` |
| legend | string | false  | The legend text for the fieldset |
| legendClasses | string | false | Classes to apply to the `<legend>` |
| description | string | false | The description text for the field or fieldset |
| noField | boolean | false | Whether or not to wrap the [caller](https://mozilla.github.io/nunjucks/templating.html#call) in a field `<div>`. This property has no effect if `legend` or `mutuallyExclusive` is provided. | 
| mutuallyExclusive | `MutuallyExclusive` [_(ref)_](/components/mutually-exclusive#configuration) | false | The mutually exclusive configuration for the field. |

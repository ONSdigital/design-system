## When to use this component
Use this component when you have identified a strong user need to quickly scan large sections of content, by condensing them into an overview of section headings, and show and hide those sections as needed.

Accordions can benefit repeat users who need to regularly perform the same familiar tasks quickly, where they only need a few key pieces of the content to proceed.

## When not to use this component
Accordions hide content from users and are not easily noticed and understood by everyone. So they should not be used if the content inside each accordion is critical to the user being able to progress with their task.

Test your content considering the following alternatives before using accordions:
{{
    onsList({
        "itemsList": [
            {
                "text": 'simplify the content to reduce down the amount'
            },
            {
                "text": 'separate the content with headings'
            },
            {
                "text": 'use page contents links to enable users to quickly to navigate to sections of content'
            },
            {
                "text": 'divide the content across multiple pages'
            }
        ]
    })
}}

### Alternative components
Accordions, [tabs](/components/tabs) and [details](/components/details) all hide sections of content which a user can show or hide.

[Tabs](/components/tabs) may work better for users who need to switch quickly between sections because the position of their headings remains static, whereas the accordion headings move down the page as you open others.

Consider the number of sections you need to display. Tabs display horizontally so cannot display as many sections as accordions which display vertically.  Also consider the use of your service on mobile devices.  Tabs only display above `640px` before their content is expanded and stacked vertically under headings.

Use the [details component](/components/details) if there is only one section of content that needs to be condensed.

## How to use this component
The functionality of accordions is provided by grouping [details components](/components/details) together.

### Use clear labels
Accordions hide content so make sure your section headings are clear so the user does not need to work hard to understand which heading to choose.


## Variants

### Open

Under certain conditions setting each item to be open by default may be appropriate. The example below shows the accordion being used in a narrow column for filtering results. 

The `allButton` property has not been configured and won't be rendered to allow the accordion to fit into a smaller area. 

To use this variant include the parameter `'open': true` in your implementation.

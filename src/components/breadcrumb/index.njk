A breadcrumb trail consists of a list of links to the parent pages of the current page in hierarchical order. It helps users find their place within a website or web application. This should be placed before a page’s main content.

## When to use this component
Use the breadcrumbs component when you need to help users understand and move between the multiple levels of a website.

## When not to use this component
Don’t use the breadcrumbs component on websites with a flat structure, or to show progress through a linear journey or transaction.

If you’re using other navigational elements on the page, such as a sidebar, consider whether your users need the additional support of breadcrumbs.

## How it works
- The set of links is structured using an **ordered** list to provide semantic structure.
- A `nav` element labeled `Breadcrumb` identifies the structure as a breadcrumb trail and makes it a navigation landmark so that it is easy to locate.
- To prevent screen reader announcing the visual separators between links, they are added via CSS.
- The separators are part of the visual presentation that signifies the breadcrumb trail. This is already semantically represented by the `nav` element with its `aria-label` of Breadcrumb. Therefore using a display technique that is not used by screen readers prevents redundant and potentially distracting verbosity.

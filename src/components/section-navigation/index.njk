Navigation to move across pages from within a main section.

## When to use this component
This component should be used to allow users to move between pages that are not necessarily at a global/site wide level but are within a specific context and need to be grouped at the same level.

## How to use this component
This component can be implemented with main navigation in the [Header](/components/header#external-with-navigation) component to give hierarchy to the content within a service. It can however, be used without any parent level navigation as a way to switch across pages of the same type, for example, moving between different views on a survey list (completed, to do, archived etc).

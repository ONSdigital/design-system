The address finder component uses the ONS Address Index API to search and retrieve UK addresses. 

{{
    patternlibExample({"path": "components/address-finder/examples/address-finder/index.njk"})
}}

## How to use

The address finder extends the code base used for the [autosuggest component](/components/autosuggest).

### Using the API

The ONS Address Index API which uses a JSON Web Token (JWT) to allow the transfer of data to take place. You will need to speak to the ONS AIMS team for requirements and set up trusted domains.

You will need to set the values for the parameters `APIDomain` and `APIDomainBearerToken` to allow queries to be passed to the API. 

### How it works

A query is sent to the relevant API endpoint after 3 characters have been entered into the input. There are various scenarios that are catered for such as groupings (of postcode results), large returns of data etc.

There are many parameters that need to be set with the address finder component. Look at the Nunjucks output on the example above to see how it should be configured.

{% from "components/panel/_macro.njk" import onsPanel %}
{% call onsPanel({})
%}
    The functionality available and parameter requirements for this component can be best understood when used within a page/form. Examples of these are available on the <a href="/patterns/addresses">address pattern page</a>.
{% endcall %}

The skip to content component lets assistive technology and keyboard-only users skip to the main content on a page, to bypass and avoid repeating focus on persistent page elements such as top-level navigation.

{{
    onsPanel({
        "classes" : "ons-u-mb-m",
        "body": "To view this component, click into the example below and press the <kbd>tab</kbd> key."
    })
}}

{{
    patternlibExample({"path": "components/skip-to-content/examples/skip-to-content/index.njk"})
}}

## When to use this component
All ONS pages must use the skip to content component above the header.

## How to use this component
The skip to content link component is visually hidden until it is brought into focus with a keyboard press.

It should be the first element of the page content, and link to the page's `#main` div.

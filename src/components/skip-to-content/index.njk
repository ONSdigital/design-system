The skip to content component lets assistive technology and keyboard-only users skip to the main content on a page, to bypass and avoid repeating focus on persistent page elements such as top-level navigation.

{{
    onsPanel({
        "classes" : "ons-u-mb-m",
        "body": "To view this component, click into the example below and press the <kbd>tab</kbd> key."
    })
}}

{{
    patternlibExample({"path": "components/skip-to-content/examples/skip-to-content/index.njk"})
}}

## When to use this component
All ONS pages must use the skip to content component above the header.

## How to use this component
The skip to content link component is visually hidden until it is brought into focus with a keyboard press.

It should be the first element of the page content if not using the [cookies banner](/patterns/cookies-settings/). If your service does use the cookies banner, then it should immediately follow.  It should link to the page's main content `div` using `#id` (`id` matching the `id` attribute if the `div`).

If using the [page template](/foundations/page-template) the skip to content component is automatically included in the correct place and will link to a `div` with an `id` of `main-content`. To override this you can manually add it using the `skipLink` block.

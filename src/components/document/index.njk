## How to use this component
We use two versions of the image, one for standard screens and the other for retina screens.

Image dimension for:

* standard screen is: `96px × 136px`
* retina screen is: `192px × 272px`

We specify a folder path for both small and large images, which is defined in the macro as `smallSrc` and `largeSrc`. The filename is expected to be the same for both.

The image used is considered decorative and does not convey important information, and as such should be hidden from screen readers. The image does not require an `alt` tag.

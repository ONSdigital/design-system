When a large quantity of files are available to download, use the [download resources pattern](/patterns/download-resources).

## How to use this component

### Thumbnail images and placeholders
You will need to set two versions of the thumbnail image, one for standard screens and one double-sized image for retina screens.

Set a folder path for both small and large image sources using the `smallSrc` and `largeSrc` parameters.

Thumbnail images are considered decorative because they do not convey important information, so are hidden from screen readers by using an empty `alt` tag.

If a document does not have a suitable image to use, set `thumbnail: true` to display a placeholder thumbnail. This will make sure the link, metadata and description is aligned with the other documents in the list.

#### Downloadable document thumbnail images
Always set a thumbnail image for a downloadable document, using the cover or first page of the file. Using a thumbnail helps set the users expectation of the file they download.

Image dimensions for downloadable document thumbnails:

* standard screen is: `96px (width) × 136px (height)`
* retina screen is: `192px × 272px`

#### News article thumbnail images
Only set thumbnails for news articles if most of the articles contain images that help describe the content. Use the same image for the thumbnail as the larger image in the article to reinforce the user’s selection.

Image dimensions for news article thumbnails:

* standard screen is: `136px x 96px`
* retina screen is: `272px × 192px`

Image dimensions for featured news article thumbnails:

* standard screen is: `379px × 248px`
* retina screen is: `758px × 496px`

<!--

(!) Before you fill in this proposal template

- If you are suggesting a change to something that already exists in the ONS Design System, please propose it by commenting on the GitHub discussion (https://github.com/ONSdigital/design-system/discussions) for that component, pattern or style. You can get to the discussion using the direct link at the bottom of each page in the Design System.

- If you are proposing something new, check the Design System backlog (https://trello.com/b/dsgMhRlq/ons-design-system) first, to make sure something similar hasn't already been proposed. Please add any examples of evidence of your own, if it has already been proposed. To request access to the backlog, email jo.van.der.plank@ons.gov.uk

## What

> Give a brief description of the new feature you want to propose for the ONS design system. This could be a new component, pattern or style, or new documentation for the Design System.

## Why

> Explain why you think this feature or content should be added to the ONS Design System.
>
> - What evidence do you have that your ONS service needs it?
> - What evidence do you have that it meets the needs of the users of that service?
> - Have you checked if itâ€™s already in the ONS Design System?
> - Have you considered creating a new variant of an existing feature instead of something new?

## Supporting material

> Include links to any examples, research, prototypes or code that support your proposal.

## Contacts

> The Design System working group has a weekly meeting. We will invite you to one of these meetings to give a show and tell about your proposal and answer any questions. Please tell us who to invite to that meeting. We recommend involving at least your product manager, user researcher and designer.

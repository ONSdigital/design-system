<!--

*** Before you fill in this proposal template ***

- If you are suggesting a change to a component, pattern or style that is already in the ONS Design System, please comment on its GitHub discussion (https://github.com/ONSdigital/design-system/discussions). You can get to the discussion using the direct link at the bottom of each page in the Design System.

- If you are proposing something new, check the Design System backlog (https://trello.com/b/dsgMhRlq/ons-design-system). There may already be a proposal for something similar. You can add examples of your own evidence to an existing proposal. To request access to the backlog, email ons.design.system@ons.gov.uk

## What

> Give a brief description of the new feature you want to propose for the Design System. This could be a component, pattern or style, or new documentation for an existing feature.

## Why

> Explain why you think this feature or content should be added to the ONS Design System.
>
> - What evidence do you have that your ONS service needs it?
> - What evidence do you have that it meets the needs of the users of that service?
> - Have you checked if itâ€™s already in the ONS Design System?
> - Have you considered creating a new variant of an existing feature instead of something new?

## Supporting material

> Include links to any examples, research, prototypes or code that support your proposal.

## Contacts

> The Design System working group has a weekly meeting. We will invite you to one of these meetings to give a show and tell about your proposal and answer any questions. Please tell us who to invite to that meeting. We recommend involving at least your product manager, user researcher and designer.
